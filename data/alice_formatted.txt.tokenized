CHAPTER I .
Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank ,_and of having nothing to do : once or twice she_had peeped into the book her sister was reading ,_but it had no pictures or conversations in it ,_‘ and what is the use of a book ,_’ thought Alice ‘ without pictures or conversations ?_’
So she_was considering in her own mind ( as well as_she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .
There was nothing so very remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so very much out of_the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself ,_‘ Oh dear !
Oh dear !
I shall be late !_’ ( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this ,_but at_the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket ,_and looked at it ,_and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she_had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it ,_and burning with curiosity ,_she ran across the field after it ,_and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge .
In another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in_the world she_was to get out again .
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way ,_and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she_had plenty of time as_she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
First ,_she tried to look down and make out what she_was coming to ,_but it_was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at_the sides of_the well ,_and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs .
She took down a jar from one of_the shelves as_she passed ; it_was labelled ‘ ORANGE MARMALADE ’ ,_but to her great disappointment it_was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of_the cupboards as_she fell past it .
‘ Well !_’ thought Alice to_herself ,_‘ after such a fall as this ,_I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
How brave they ’ ll all think me at home !
Why ,_I wouldn ’_t say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of_the house !_’ ( Which was very likely true . )
Down , down , down .
Would the fall never come to an end !
‘_I wonder how many miles I_’ ve fallen by this time ?_’ she said aloud .
‘_I must be getting somewhere near the centre of_the earth .
Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down ,_I think— ’ ( for ,_you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in_the schoolroom ,_and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge ,_as there was no one to listen to her , still it_was good practice to say it over ) ‘ —yes ,_that ’_s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I_’ ve got to ?_’ ( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either ,_but thought they were nice grand words to say . )
Presently she began again .
‘_I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth !
How funny it ’ ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !
The Antipathies ,_I think— ’ ( she_was rather glad there was no one listening , this time ,_as it didn ’_t sound at all the right word ) ‘ —but I shall have to ask them what the name of_the country is ,_you know .
Please , Ma ’ am , is this New Zealand or Australia ?_’ ( and she tried to curtsey as_she spoke—fancy curtseying as you ’_re falling through the air !
Do you think you could manage it ? )
‘ And what an ignorant little girl she ’ ll think me for asking !
No , it ’ ll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere ._’
Down , down , down .
There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again .
‘ Dinah ’ ll miss me very much to-night ,_I should think !_’ ( Dinah was the cat . )
‘_I hope they ’ ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time .
Dinah my dear !
I wish you were down here with me !
There are no mice in_the air , I_’_m afraid ,_but you might catch a bat ,_and that ’_s very like a mouse ,_you know .
But do cats eat bats ,_I wonder ?_’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy ,_and went_on saying to_herself , in_a dreamy sort of way ,_‘ Do cats eat bats ?
Do cats eat bats ?_’ and sometimes ,_‘ Do bats eat cats ?_’ for ,_you see ,_as she couldn ’_t answer either question , it didn ’_t much matter which way she put it .
She felt that she_was dozing off ,_and had just begun to dream that she_was walking hand in hand with Dinah ,_and saying to her very earnestly ,_‘ Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ?_’ when suddenly , thump !
thump !
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves ,_and_the fall was over .
Alice was not a bit hurt ,_and she jumped up on to her feet in_a moment : she looked up ,_but it_was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage ,_and_the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
There was not a moment to_be lost : away went Alice like the wind ,_and was just in time to hear it say ,_as it turned a corner ,_‘ Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it ’_s getting !_’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner ,_but the Rabbit was no longer to_be seen : she found herself in_a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .
There were doors all round the hall ,_but they were all locked ;_and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door ,_she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she_was ever to get out again .
Suddenly she came upon a_little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key ,_and Alice ’_s first thought was that it might belong to one of_the doors of_the hall ; but , alas !
either the locks were too large , or the key was too small ,_but at any rate it would not open any of them .
However , on the second time round ,_she came upon a low curtain she_had not noticed before ,_and behind it_was a_little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in_the lock ,_and to her great delight it fitted !
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .
How she longed to get out of that dark hall ,_and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains ,_but she could not even get her head through the doorway ;_‘ and even if my head would go through ,_’ thought poor Alice ,_‘ it would be of very little use without my shoulders .
Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !
I think I could , if I only knew how to begin. ’ For ,_you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately ,_that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
There seemed to_be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to_the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a_little bottle on it , ( ‘ which certainly was not here before ,_’_said_Alice , ) and round the neck of_the bottle was a paper label ,_with the words ‘ DRINK ME ’ beautifully printed on it in large letters .
It was all very well to say ‘ Drink me ,_’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in_a hurry .
‘ No , I_’ ll look first ,_’ she said ,_‘ and see whether it ’_s marked “ poison ” or not ’ ; for she_had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt ,_and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as ,_that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ;_and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ;_and she_had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘ poison ,_’ it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
However , this bottle was not marked ‘ poison ,_’ so Alice ventured to taste it ,_and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee ,_and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .

‘ What a curious feeling !_’ said_Alice ; ‘_I must be shutting up like a telescope ._’
And so it_was indeed : she_was now only ten inches high ,_and her face brightened up at_the thought that she_was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .
First , however ,_she waited for a few minutes to see if she_was going to shrink any further : she felt a_little nervous about this ;_‘ for it might end ,_you know ,_’_said_Alice to_herself ,_‘ in my going out altogether , like a candle .
I wonder what I should be like then ?_’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing .
After a while , finding that nothing more happened ,_she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice !
when she got to_the door ,_she found she_had forgotten the little golden key ,_and when she went back to_the table for it ,_she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass ,_and she tried her best to climb up one of_the legs of_the table ,_but it_was too slippery ;_and when she_had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
‘ Come , there ’_s no use in crying like that !_’ said_Alice to_herself , rather sharply ; ‘_I advise you to leave off this minute !_’ She generally gave herself very good advice , ( though she very seldom followed it ) ,_and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ;_and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in_a game of croquet she_was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to_be two people .
‘ But it ’_s no use now ,_’ thought poor Alice ,_‘ to pretend to_be two people !
Why , there ’_s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person !_’
Soon her eye fell on a_little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it ,_and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ‘ EAT ME ’ were beautifully marked in currants .
‘ Well , I_’ ll eat it ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ and if it makes me grow larger ,_I can reach the key ;_and if it makes me grow smaller ,_I can creep under the door ; so either way I_’ ll get into the garden ,_and I don_’_t care which happens !_’
She ate a_little bit ,_and said anxiously to_herself ,_‘ Which way ?
Which way ?_’ , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it_was growing ,_and she_was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to_be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake ,_but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen ,_that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in_the common way .
So she set to work ,_and very soon finished off the cake .

CHAPTER II .
The Pool of Tears
‘ Curiouser and curiouser !_’ cried Alice ( she_was so much surprised ,_that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ;_‘ now I_’_m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
Good-bye , feet !_’ ( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to_be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ) .
‘ Oh , my poor little feet ,_I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
I_’_m sure I shan ’_t be able !
I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ; —but I must be kind to them ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ or perhaps they won ’_t walk the way I want to go !
Let me see : I_’ ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas ._’
And she went_on planning to_herself how she would manage it .
‘ They must go by the carrier ,_’ she thought ;_‘ and how funny it ’ ll seem , sending presents to one ’_s own feet !
And how odd the directions will look !
Alice ’_s Right Foot , Esq .
Hearthrug ,
near The Fender ,
( with Alice ’_s love ) .
Oh dear , what nonsense I_’_m talking !_’
Just then her head struck against the roof of_the hall : in fact she_was now more than nine feet high ,_and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to_the garden door .
Poor Alice !
It was as much as_she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .
‘_You ought to_be ashamed of yourself ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ a great girl like you ,_’ ( she might well say this ) ,_‘ to go on crying in this way !
Stop this moment ,_I tell you !_’ But she went_on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall .
After a time she heard a_little pattering of feet in_the distance ,_and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed ,_with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in_the other : he came trotting along in_a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came ,_‘ Oh !
the Duchess , the Duchess !
Oh !
won ’_t she be savage if I_’ ve kept her waiting !_’ Alice felt so desperate that she_was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her ,_she began , in_a low , timid voice ,_‘ If you please , sir— ’ The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan ,_and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .
Alice took up the fan and gloves ,_and ,_as the hall was very hot ,_she kept fanning herself all the time she went_on talking :_‘ Dear , dear !
How queer everything is to-day !
And yesterday things went_on just as usual .
I wonder if I_’ ve been changed in_the night ?
Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ?
I almost think I can remember feeling a_little different .
But if I_’_m not the same , the next question is , Who in_the world am I ?
Ah ,_that ’_s the great puzzle !_’ And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of_the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
‘_I_’ m sure I_’_m not Ada ,_’ she said ,_‘ for her hair goes in such long ringlets ,_and mine doesn ’_t go in ringlets at all ;_and I_’_m sure I can ’_t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things ,_and she , oh !
she knows such a very little !
Besides ,_she ’_s she ,_and I_’_m I , and—oh dear , how puzzling it all is !
I_’ ll try if I know all the things I used to know .
Let me see : four times five is twelve ,_and four times six is thirteen ,_and four times seven is—oh dear !
I shall never get to twenty at that rate !
However , the Multiplication Table doesn ’_t signify : let ’_s try Geography .
London is the capital of Paris ,_and Paris is the capital of Rome ,_and Rome—no ,_that ’_s all wrong , I_’_m certain !
I must have been changed for Mabel !
I_’ ll try and say “ How doth the little— “ ’ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons ,_and began to repeat it ,_but her voice sounded hoarse and strange ,_and_the words did not come the same as they used to do : —
‘ How doth the little crocodile
Improve his shining tail ,
And pour the waters of_the Nile
On every golden scale !
‘ How cheerfully he seems to grin ,
How neatly spread his claws ,
And welcome little fishes in
With gently smiling jaws !_’
‘_I_’ m sure those are not the right words ,_’_said poor Alice ,_and her eyes filled with tears again as_she went_on ,_‘ I must be Mabel after all ,_and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house ,_and have next to no toys to play with ,_and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
No , I_’ ve made up my mind about it ; if I_’_m Mabel , I_’ ll stay down here !
It ’ ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying “ Come up again , dear ! ” I shall only look up and say “ Who am I then ?
Tell me that first ,_and then , if I like being that person , I_’ ll come up : if not , I_’ ll stay down here till I_’_m somebody else ” —but , oh dear !_’ cried Alice ,_with a sudden burst of tears ,_‘ I do wish they would put their heads down !
I am so very tired of being all alone here !_’
As she said this she looked down at her hands ,_and was surprised to see that she_had put on one of_the Rabbit ’_s little white kid gloves while she_was talking .
‘ How can I have done that ?_’ she thought .
‘_I must be growing small again. ’ She got up and went to_the table to measure herself by it ,_and found that ,_as nearly as_she could guess ,_she was now about two feet high ,_and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she_was holding ,_and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .
‘ That was a narrow escape !_’ said_Alice , a good deal frightened at_the sudden change ,_but very glad to find herself still in existence ;_‘ and now for the garden !_’ and she ran with all speed back to_the little door : but , alas !
the little door was shut again ,_and_the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before ,_‘ and things are worse than ever ,_’ thought the poor child ,_‘ for I never was so small as this before , never !
And I declare it ’_s too bad ,_that it is !_’
As she said these words her foot slipped ,_and in another moment , splash !
she_was up to her chin in salt water .
Her first idea was that she_had somehow fallen into the sea ,_‘ and in that case I can go back by railway ,_’ she said to_herself .
( Alice had been to_the seaside once in her life ,_and had come to_the general conclusion ,_that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in_the sea , some children digging in_the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses ,_and behind them a railway station . )
However ,_she soon made out that she_was in_the pool of tears which she_had wept when she_was nine feet high .
‘_I wish I hadn ’_t cried so much !_’ said_Alice ,_as she swam about , trying to find her way out .
‘_I shall be punished for it now ,_I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
That will be a queer thing , to_be sure !
However , everything is queer to-day ._’
Just then she heard something splashing about in_the pool a_little way off ,_and she swam nearer to make out what it_was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus ,_but then she remembered how small she_was now ,_and she soon made out that it_was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
‘ Would it be of any use , now ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ to speak to this mouse ?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here ,_that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there ’_s no harm in trying. ’ So she began :_‘ O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ?
I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse !_’ ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she_had never done such a thing before ,_but she remembered having seen in her brother ’_s Latin Grammar ,_‘ A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse !_’ ) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively ,_and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes ,_but it said nothing .
‘ Perhaps it doesn ’_t understand English ,_’ thought Alice ; ‘_I daresay it ’_s a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror. ’ ( For ,_with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . )
So she began again :_‘ Ou est ma chatte ?_’ which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of_the water ,_and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
‘ Oh ,_I beg your pardon !_’ cried Alice hastily , afraid that she_had hurt the poor animal ’_s feelings .
‘_I quite forgot you didn ’_t like cats ._’
‘ Not like cats !_’ cried the Mouse , in_a shrill , passionate voice .
‘ Would you like cats if you were me ?_’
‘ Well , perhaps not ,_’_said_Alice in_a soothing tone :_‘ don_’_t be angry about it .
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you ’ d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
She is such a dear quiet thing ,_’ Alice went_on , half to_herself ,_as she swam lazily about in_the pool ,_‘ and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she ’_s such a capital one for catching mice—oh ,_I beg your pardon !_’ cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over ,_and she felt certain it must be really offended .
‘ We won ’_t talk about her any more if you ’ d rather not ._’
‘ We indeed !_’ cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to_the end of his tail .
‘ As if I would talk on such a subject !
Our family always hated cats : nasty , low , vulgar things !
Don ’_t let me hear the name again !_’
‘_I won ’_t indeed !_’ said_Alice , in_a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .
‘ Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs ?_’ The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went_on eagerly :_‘ There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you !
A little bright-eyed terrier ,_you know ,_with oh , such long curly brown hair !
And it ’ ll fetch things when you throw them ,_and it ’ ll sit up and beg for its dinner ,_and all sorts of things—I can ’_t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer ,_you know ,_and he says it ’_s so useful , it ’_s worth a hundred pounds !
He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear !_’ cried Alice in_a sorrowful tone ,_‘ I_’_m afraid I_’ ve offended it again !_’ For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go ,_and making quite a commotion in_the pool as it went .
So she called softly after it ,_‘ Mouse dear !
Do come back again ,_and we won ’_t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don_’_t like them !_’ When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ) ,_and it said in_a low trembling voice ,_‘ Let us get to_the shore ,_and then I_’ ll tell you my history ,_and you ’ ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs ._’
It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet ,_and several other curious creatures .
Alice led the way ,_and_the whole party swam to_the shore .
CHAPTER III .
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them ,_and all dripping wet , cross ,_and uncomfortable .
The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this ,_and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them ,_as if she_had known them all her life .
Indeed , she_had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky ,_and would only say ,_‘ I am older than you ,_and must know better ’ ;_and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it_was ,_and ,_as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to_be said .
At last the Mouse , who seemed to_be a person of authority among them , called out ,_‘ Sit down , all of you ,_and listen to me !
I_’ ll soon make you dry enough !_’ They all sat down at once , in_a large ring ,_with the Mouse in_the middle .
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .
‘ Ahem !_’_said_the Mouse with an important air ,_‘ are you all ready ?
This is the driest thing I know .
Silence all round , if you please !
“ William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders ,_and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest .
Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria— “ ’
‘ Ugh !_’_said_the Lory ,_with a shiver .
‘_I beg your pardon !_’_said_the Mouse , frowning ,_but very politely :_‘ Did you speak ?_’
‘ Not I !_’_said_the Lory hastily .
‘_I thought you did ,_’_said_the Mouse .
‘ —I proceed .
“ Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable— “ ’
‘ Found what ?_’ said_the Duck .
‘ Found it ,_’_the Mouse replied rather crossly :_‘ of course you know what “ it ” means ._’
‘_I know what “ it ” means well enough , when I find a thing ,_’_said_the Duck :_‘ it ’_s generally a frog or a worm .
The question is , what did the archbishop find ?_’
The Mouse did not notice this question ,_but hurriedly went_on ,_‘ “ —found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown .
William ’_s conduct at first was moderate .
But the insolence of his Normans— ” How are you getting on now , my dear ?_’ it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke .
‘ As wet as ever ,_’_said_Alice in_a melancholy tone :_‘ it doesn ’_t seem to dry me at all ._’
‘ In that case ,_’_said_the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet ,_‘ I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies— ’
‘ Speak English !_’_said_the Eaglet .
‘_I don_’_t know the meaning of half those long words ,_and , what ’_s more ,_I don_’_t believe you do either !_’ And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of_the other birds tittered audibly .
‘ What I was going to say ,_’_said_the Dodo in an offended tone ,_‘ was ,_that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race ._’
‘ What is a Caucus-race ?_’ said_Alice ; not that she wanted much to know ,_but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak ,_and no one else seemed inclined to say anything .
‘ Why ,_’_said_the Dodo ,_‘ the best way to explain it is to do it. ’ ( And ,_as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day ,_I will tell you how the Dodo managed it . )
First it marked out a race-course , in_a sort of circle , ( ‘ the exact shape doesn ’_t matter ,_’ it said , ) and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there .
There was no ‘ One , two , three ,_and away ,_’ but they began running when they liked ,_and left off when they liked , so that it_was not easy to know when the race was over .
However , when they had been running half an hour or so ,_and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ‘ The race is over !_’ and they all crowded round it , panting ,_and asking ,_‘ But who has won ?_’
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought ,_and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in_the pictures of him ) , while the rest waited in silence .
At last the Dodo said ,_‘ Everybody has won ,_and all must have prizes ._’
‘ But who is to give the prizes ?_’ quite a chorus of voices asked .
‘ Why ,_she , of course ,_’_said_the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ;_and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in_a confused way ,_‘ Prizes !
Prizes !_’
Alice had no idea what to do ,_and in despair she put her hand in her pocket ,_and pulled out a box of comfits , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) ,_and handed them round as prizes .
There was exactly one a-piece all round .
‘ But she must have a prize herself ,_you know ,_’_said_the Mouse .
‘ Of course ,_’_the Dodo replied very gravely .
‘ What else have you got in your pocket ?_’ he went_on , turning to Alice .
‘ Only a thimble ,_’_said_Alice sadly .
‘ Hand it over here ,_’_said_the Dodo .
Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying ‘ We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ’ ;_and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered .
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd ,_but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ;_and ,_as she could not think of anything to say ,_she simply bowed ,_and took the thimble , looking as solemn as_she could .
The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion ,_as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs ,_and_the small ones choked and had to_be patted on the back .
However , it_was over at last ,_and they sat down again in_a ring ,_and begged the Mouse to tell them something more .
‘_You promised to tell me your history ,_you know ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ and why it is you hate—C and D ,_’ she added in_a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again .
‘ Mine is a long and a sad tale !_’_said_the Mouse , turning to Alice ,_and sighing .
‘_It is a long tail , certainly ,_’_said_Alice , looking down with wonder at_the Mouse ’_s tail ;_‘ but why do you call it sad ?_’ And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of_the tale was something like this : —
‘ Fury said to a
mouse , That he
met in_the
house ,
“ Let us
both go to
law : I will
prosecute
you.—Come ,
I_’ ll take no
denial ; We
must have a
trial : For
really this
morning I_’ ve
nothing
to do . ”
Said the
mouse to_the
cur , “ Such
a trial ,
dear Sir ,
With
no jury
or judge ,
would be
wasting
our
breath . ”
“ I_’ ll be
judge , I_’ ll
be jury , ”
Said
cunning
old Fury :
“ I_’ ll
try the
whole
cause ,
and
condemn
you
to
death . ” ’
‘_You are not attending !_’_said_the Mouse to Alice severely .
‘ What are you thinking of ?_’
‘_I beg your pardon ,_’_said_Alice very humbly :_‘ you had got to_the fifth bend ,_I think ?_’
‘_I had not !_’ cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily .
‘ A knot !_’ said_Alice , always ready to make herself useful ,_and looking anxiously about her .
‘ Oh , do let me help to undo it !_’
‘_I shall do nothing of_the sort ,_’_said_the Mouse , getting up and walking away .
‘_You insult me by talking such nonsense !_’
‘_I didn ’_t mean it !_’ pleaded poor Alice .
‘ But you ’_re so easily offended ,_you know !_’
The Mouse only growled in reply .
‘ Please come back and finish your story !_’ Alice called after it ;_and the others all joined in chorus ,_‘ Yes , please do !_’ but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently ,_and walked a_little quicker .
‘ What a pity it wouldn ’_t stay !_’ sighed the Lory ,_as soon as it_was quite out of sight ;_and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ‘ Ah , my dear !
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper !_’ ‘ Hold your tongue , Ma !_’_said_the young Crab , a_little snappishly .
‘_You ’_re enough to try the patience of an oyster !_’
‘_I wish I had our Dinah here ,_I know I do !_’ said_Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular .
‘ She ’ d soon fetch it back !_’
‘ And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ?_’ said_the Lory .
Alice replied eagerly , for she_was always ready to talk about her pet :_‘ Dinah ’_s our cat .
And she ’_s such a capital one for catching mice you can ’_t think !
And oh ,_I wish you could see her after the birds !
Why ,_she ’ ll eat a_little bird as soon as look at it !_’
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party .
Some of_the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking ,_‘ I really must be getting home ; the night-air doesn ’_t suit my throat !_’ and a Canary called out in_a trembling voice to its children ,_‘ Come away , my dears !
It ’_s high time you were all in bed !_’ On various pretexts they all moved off ,_and Alice was soon left alone .
‘_I wish I hadn ’_t mentioned Dinah !_’ she said to_herself in_a melancholy tone .
‘ Nobody seems to like her , down here ,_and I_’_m sure she ’_s the best cat in_the world !
Oh , my dear Dinah !
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more !_’ And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited .
In a_little while , however ,_she again heard a_little pattering of footsteps in_the distance ,_and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind ,_and was coming back to finish his story .
CHAPTER IV .
The Rabbit Sends in_a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again ,_and looking anxiously about as it went ,_as if it had lost something ;_and she heard it muttering to itself ‘ The Duchess !
The Duchess !
Oh my dear paws !
Oh my fur and whiskers !
She ’ ll get me executed ,_as sure as ferrets are ferrets !
Where can I have dropped them ,_I wonder ?_’ Alice guessed in_a moment that it_was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves ,_and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them ,_but they were nowhere to_be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in_the pool ,_and_the great hall ,_with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice ,_as she went hunting about ,_and called out to her in an angry tone ,_‘ Why , Mary Ann , what are you doing out here ?
Run home this moment ,_and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
Quick , now !_’ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in_the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made .
‘ He took me for his housemaid ,_’ she said to_herself as_she ran .
‘ How surprised he ’ ll be when he finds out who I am !
But I_’ d better take him his fan and gloves—that is , if I can find them. ’ As she said this ,_she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ‘ W .
RABBIT ’ engraved upon it .
She went in without knocking ,_and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann ,_and be turned out of_the house before she_had found the fan and gloves .
‘ How queer it seems ,_’ Alice said to_herself ,_‘ to_be going messages for a rabbit !
I suppose Dinah ’ ll be sending me on messages next !_’ And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen :_‘ “ Miss Alice !
Come here directly ,_and get ready for your walk ! ” “ Coming in_a minute , nurse !
But I_’ ve got to see that the mouse doesn ’_t get out. ” Only I don_’_t think ,_’ Alice went_on ,_‘ that they ’ d let Dinah stop in_the house if it began ordering people about like that !_’
By this time she_had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in_the window ,_and on it ( as she_had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of_the gloves ,_and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a_little bottle that stood near the looking-glass .
There was no label this time with the words ‘ DRINK ME ,_’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips .
‘_I know something interesting is sure to happen ,_’ she said to_herself ,_‘ whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I_’ ll just see what this bottle does .
I do hope it ’ ll make me grow large again , for really I_’_m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing !_’
It did so indeed ,_and much sooner than she_had expected : before she_had drunk half the bottle ,_she found her head pressing against the ceiling ,_and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken .
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to_herself ‘ That ’_s quite enough—I hope I shan ’_t grow any more—As it is ,_I can ’_t get out at_the door—I do wish I hadn ’_t drunk quite so much !_’
Alas !
it_was too late to wish that !
She went_on growing ,_and growing ,_and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this ,_and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door ,_and_the other arm curled round her head .
Still she went_on growing ,_and ,_as a last resource ,_she put one arm out of_the window ,_and one foot up the chimney ,_and said to_herself ‘ Now I can do no more , whatever happens .
What will become of me ?_’
Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect ,_and she grew no larger : still it_was very uncomfortable ,_and ,_as there seemed to_be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of_the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
‘_It was much pleasanter at home ,_’ thought poor Alice ,_‘ when one wasn ’_t always growing larger and smaller ,_and being ordered about by mice and rabbits .
I almost wish I hadn ’_t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it ’_s rather curious ,_you know , this sort of life !
I do wonder what can have happened to me !
When I used to read fairy-tales ,_I fancied that kind of thing never happened ,_and now here I am in_the middle of one !
There ought to_be a book written about me ,_that there ought !
And when I grow up , I_’ ll write one—but I_’_m grown up now ,_’ she added in_a sorrowful tone ;_‘ at least there ’_s no room to grow up any more here ._’
‘ But then ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ shall I never get any older than I am now ?
That ’ ll be a comfort , one way—never to_be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn !
Oh ,_I shouldn ’_t like that !_’
‘ Oh ,_you foolish Alice !_’ she answered herself .
‘ How can you learn lessons in here ?
Why , there ’_s hardly room for you ,_and no room at all for any lesson-books !_’
And so she went_on , taking first one side and then the other ,_and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside ,_and stopped to listen .
‘ Mary Ann !
Mary Ann !_’_said_the voice .
‘ Fetch me my gloves this moment !_’ Then came a_little pattering of feet on the stairs .
Alice knew it_was the Rabbit coming to look for her ,_and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she_was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit ,_and had no reason to_be afraid of it .
Presently the Rabbit came up to_the door ,_and tried to open it ; but ,_as the door opened inwards ,_and Alice ’_s elbow was pressed hard against it ,_that attempt proved a failure .
Alice heard it say to itself ‘ Then I_’ ll go round and get in at_the window ._’
‘ That you won ’_t ’ thought Alice ,_and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window ,_she suddenly spread out her hand ,_and made a snatch in_the air .
She did not get hold of anything ,_but she heard a_little shriek and a fall ,_and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it_was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame , or something of_the sort .
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit ’ s— ‘ Pat !
Pat !
Where are you ?_’ And then a voice she_had never heard before ,_‘ Sure then I_’_m here !
Digging for apples , yer honour !_’
‘ Digging for apples , indeed !_’_said_the Rabbit angrily .
‘ Here !
Come and help me out of this !_’ ( Sounds of more broken glass . )
‘ Now tell me , Pat , what ’_s that in_the window ?_’
‘ Sure , it ’_s an arm , yer honour !_’ ( He pronounced it ‘ arrum ._’ )
‘ An arm ,_you goose !
Who ever saw one that size ?
Why , it fills the whole window !_’
‘ Sure , it does , yer honour : but it ’_s an arm for all that ._’
‘ Well , it ’_s got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away !_’
There was a long silence after this ,_and Alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as ,_‘ Sure ,_I don_’_t like it , yer honour , at all , at all !_’ ‘ Do as I tell you ,_you coward !_’ and at last she spread out her hand again ,_and made another snatch in_the air .
This time there were two little shrieks ,_and more sounds of broken glass .
‘ What a number of cucumber-frames there must be !_’ thought Alice .
‘_I wonder what they ’ ll do next !
As for pulling me out of_the window ,_I only wish they could !
I_’_m sure I don_’_t want to stay in here any longer !_’
She waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels ,_and_the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words :_‘ Where ’_s the other ladder ? —Why ,_I hadn ’_t to bring but one ; Bill ’_s got the other—Bill !
fetch it here , lad ! —Here , put ‘ em up at this corner—No , tie ‘ em together first—they don_’_t reach half high enough yet—Oh !
they ’ ll do well enough ; don_’_t be particular—Here , Bill !
catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear ? —Mind that loose slate—Oh , it ’_s coming down !
Heads below !_’ ( a loud crash ) — ‘ Now , who did that ? —It was Bill ,_I fancy—Who ’_s to go down the chimney ? —Nay ,_I shan ’_t !
You do it ! —That I won ’_t , then ! —Bill ’_s to go down—Here , Bill !
the master says you ’_re to go down the chimney !_’
‘ Oh !
So Bill ’_s got to come down the chimney , has he ?_’ said_Alice to_herself .
‘ Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill !
I wouldn ’_t be in Bill ’_s place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to_be sure ; but I think I can kick a_little !_’
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as_she could ,_and waited till she heard a_little animal ( she couldn ’_t guess of what sort it_was ) scratching and scrambling about in_the chimney close above her : then , saying to_herself ‘ This is Bill ,_’ she gave one sharp kick ,_and waited to see what would happen next .
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘ There goes Bill !_’ then the Rabbit ’_s voice along— ‘ Catch him ,_you by the hedge !_’ then silence ,_and then another confusion of voices— ‘ Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don ’_t choke him—How was it , old fellow ?
What happened to you ?
Tell us all about it !_’
Last came a_little feeble , squeaking voice , ( ‘ That ’_s Bill ,_’ thought Alice , ) ‘ Well ,_I hardly know—No more , thank ye ; I_’_m better now—but I_’_m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box ,_and up I goes like a sky-rocket !_’
‘ So you did , old fellow !_’_said_the others .
‘ We must burn the house down !_’_said_the Rabbit ’_s voice ;_and Alice called out as loud as_she could ,_‘ If you do .
I_’ ll set Dinah at you !_’
There was a dead silence instantly ,_and Alice thought to_herself ,_‘ I wonder what they will do next !
If they had any sense , they ’ d take the roof off. ’ After a minute or two , they began moving about again ,_and Alice heard the Rabbit say ,_‘ A barrowful will do , to begin with ._’
‘ A barrowful of what ?_’ thought Alice ; but she_had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at_the window ,_and some of them hit her in_the face .
‘_I_’ ll put a stop to this ,_’ she said to_herself ,_and shouted out ,_‘ You ’ d better not do that again !_’ which produced another dead silence .
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor ,_and a bright idea came into her head .
‘ If I eat one of these cakes ,_’ she thought ,_‘ it ’_s sure to make some change in my size ;_and as it can ’_t possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller ,_I suppose ._’
So she swallowed one of_the cakes ,_and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly .
As soon as she_was small enough to get through the door ,_she ran out of_the house ,_and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside .
The poor little Lizard , Bill , was in_the middle , being held up by two guinea-pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle .
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as_she could ,_and soon found herself safe in_a thick wood .
‘ The first thing I_’ ve got to do ,_’_said_Alice to_herself ,_as she wandered about in_the wood ,_‘ is to grow to my right size again ;_and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden .
I think that will be the best plan ._’
It sounded an excellent plan , no doubt ,_and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was ,_that she_had not the smallest idea how to set about it ;_and while she_was peering about anxiously among the trees , a_little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in_a great hurry .
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes ,_and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her .
‘ Poor little thing !_’ said_Alice , in_a coaxing tone ,_and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she_was terribly frightened all the time at_the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing .
Hardly knowing what she did ,_she picked up a_little bit of stick ,_and held it out to_the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once ,_with a yelp of delight ,_and rushed at_the stick ,_and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ;_and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at_the stick ,_and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it_was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse ,_and expecting every moment to_be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at_the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back ,_and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting ,_with its tongue hanging out of its mouth ,_and its great eyes half shut .
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once ,_and ran till she_was quite tired and out of breath ,_and till the puppy ’_s bark sounded quite faint in_the distance .
‘ And yet what a dear little puppy it_was !_’ said_Alice ,_as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself ,_and fanned herself with one of_the leaves : ‘_I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if—if I_’ d only been the right size to do it !
Oh dear !
I_’ d nearly forgotten that I_’ ve got to grow up again !
Let me see—how is it to_be managed ?
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?_’
The great question certainly was , what ?
Alice looked all round her at_the flowers and the blades of grass ,_but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances .
There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ;_and when she_had looked under it ,_and on both sides of it ,_and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .
She stretched herself up on tiptoe ,_and peeped over the edge of_the mushroom ,_and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar ,_that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah ,_and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth ,_and addressed her in_a languid , sleepy voice .
‘ Who are you ?_’ said_the Caterpillar .
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation .
Alice replied , rather shyly ,_‘ I—I hardly know , sir , just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning ,_but I think I must have been changed several times since then ._’
‘ What do you mean by that ?_’ said_the Caterpillar sternly .
‘ Explain yourself !_’
‘_I can ’_t explain myself , I_’_m afraid , sir ’ said_Alice ,_‘ because I_’_m not myself ,_you see ._’
‘_I don_’_t see ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
‘_I_’ m afraid I can ’_t put it more clearly ,_’ Alice replied very politely ,_‘ for I can ’_t understand it myself to begin with ;_and being so many different sizes in_a day is very confusing ._’
‘_It isn ’_t ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Well , perhaps you haven ’_t found it so yet ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day ,_you know—and then after that into a butterfly ,_I should think you ’ ll feel it a_little queer , won ’_t you ?_’
‘ Not a bit ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Well , perhaps your feelings may be different ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ all I know is , it would feel very queer to me ._’
‘_You !_’_said_the Caterpillar contemptuously .
‘ Who are you ?_’
Which brought them back again to_the beginning of_the conversation .
Alice felt a_little irritated at_the Caterpillar ’_s making such very short remarks ,_and she drew herself up and said , very gravely ,_‘ I think ,_you ought to tell me who you are , first ._’
‘ Why ?_’ said_the Caterpillar .
Here was another puzzling question ;_and as Alice could not think of any good reason ,_and as the Caterpillar seemed to_be in_a very unpleasant state of mind ,_she turned away .
‘ Come back !_’ the Caterpillar called after her .
‘_I_’ ve something important to say !_’
This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again .
‘ Keep your temper ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Is that all ?_’ said_Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as_she could .
‘ No ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
Alice thought she might as well wait ,_as she_had nothing else to do ,_and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing .
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking ,_but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again ,_and said ,_‘ So you think you ’_re changed , do you ?_’
‘_I_’ m afraid I am , sir ,_’_said_Alice ; ‘_I can ’_t remember things as I used—and I don_’_t keep the same size for ten minutes together !_’
‘ Can ’_t remember what things ?_’ said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Well , I_’ ve tried to say “ How doth the little busy bee , ” but it all came different !_’ Alice replied in_a very melancholy voice .
‘ Repeat , “ You are old , Father William , ” ’ said_the Caterpillar .
Alice folded her hands ,_and began : —
‘_You are old , Father William ,_’_the young man said ,
‘ And your hair has become very white ;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think , at your age , it is right ?_’
‘ In my youth ,_’ Father William replied to his son ,
‘_I feared it might injure the brain ;
But , now that I_’_m perfectly sure I have none ,
Why ,_I do it again and again ._’
‘_You are old ,_’_said_the youth ,_‘ as I mentioned before ,
And have grown most uncommonly fat ;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at_the door—
Pray , what is the reason of that ?_’
‘ In my youth ,_’_said_the sage ,_as he shook his grey locks ,
‘_I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
Allow me to sell you a couple ?_’
‘_You are old ,_’_said_the youth ,_‘ and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet ;
Yet you finished the goose ,_with the bones and the beak—
Pray how did you manage to do it ?_’
‘ In my youth ,_’_said his father ,_‘ I took to_the law ,
And argued each case with my wife ;
And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw ,
Has lasted the rest of my life ._’
‘_You are old ,_’_said_the youth ,_‘ one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever ;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever ?_’
‘_I have answered three questions ,_and that is enough ,_’
Said his father ;_‘ don_’_t give yourself airs !
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ?
Be off , or I_’ ll kick you down stairs !_’
‘ That is not said right ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Not quite right , I_’_m afraid ,_’_said_Alice , timidly ;_‘ some of_the words have got altered ._’
‘_It is wrong from beginning to end ,_’_said_the Caterpillar decidedly ,_and there was silence for some minutes .
The Caterpillar was the first to speak .
‘ What size do you want to_be ?_’ it asked .
‘ Oh , I_’_m not particular as to size ,_’ Alice hastily replied ;_‘ only one doesn ’_t like changing so often ,_you know ._’
‘_I don_’_t know ,_’_said_the Caterpillar .
Alice said nothing : she_had never been so much contradicted in her life before ,_and she felt that she_was losing her temper .
‘ Are you content now ?_’ said_the Caterpillar .
‘ Well ,_I should like to_be a_little larger , sir , if you wouldn ’_t mind ,_’_said_Alice :_‘ three inches is such a wretched height to_be ._’
‘_It is a very good height indeed !_’_said_the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it_was exactly three inches high ) .
‘ But I_’_m not used to it !_’ pleaded poor Alice in_a piteous tone .
And she thought of herself ,_‘ I wish the creatures wouldn ’_t be so easily offended !_’
‘_You ’ ll get used to it in time ,_’_said_the Caterpillar ;_and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again .
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice ,_and shook itself .
Then it got down off the mushroom ,_and crawled away in_the grass , merely remarking as it went ,_‘ One side will make you grow taller ,_and_the other side will make you grow shorter ._’
‘ One side of what ?
The other side of what ?_’ thought Alice to_herself .
‘ Of the mushroom ,_’_said_the Caterpillar , just as if she_had asked it aloud ;_and in another moment it_was out of sight .
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at_the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ;_and as it_was perfectly round ,_she found this a very difficult question .
However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go ,_and broke off a bit of_the edge with each hand .
‘ And now which is which ?_’ she said to_herself ,_and nibbled a_little of_the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot !
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change ,_but she felt that there was no time to_be lost ,_as she_was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of_the other bit .
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot ,_that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last ,_and managed to swallow a morsel of_the lefthand bit .
*_* *_* *_* *
*_* *_* *_*
*_* *_* *_* *
‘ Come , my head ’_s free at last !_’ said_Alice in_a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to_be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .
‘ What can all that green stuff be ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ And where have my shoulders got to ?
And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can ’_t see you ?_’ She was moving them about as_she spoke ,_but no result seemed to follow , except a_little shaking among the distant green leaves .
As there seemed to_be no chance of getting her hands up to her head ,_she tried to get her head down to them ,_and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent .
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag ,_and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to_be nothing but the tops of_the trees under which she_had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in_a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face ,_and was beating her violently with its wings .
‘ Serpent !_’ screamed the Pigeon .
‘_I_’ m not a serpent !_’ said_Alice indignantly .
‘ Let me alone !_’
‘ Serpent ,_I say again !_’ repeated the Pigeon ,_but in_a more subdued tone ,_and added with a kind of sob ,_‘ I_’ ve tried every way ,_and nothing seems to suit them !_’
‘_I haven ’_t the least idea what you ’_re talking about ,_’_said_Alice .
‘_I_’ ve tried the roots of trees ,_and I_’ ve tried banks ,_and I_’ ve tried hedges ,_’_the Pigeon went_on , without attending to her ;_‘ but those serpents !
There ’_s no pleasing them !_’
Alice was more and more puzzled ,_but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished .
‘ As if it wasn ’_t trouble enough hatching the eggs ,_’_said_the Pigeon ;_‘ but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day !
Why ,_I haven ’_t had a wink of sleep these three weeks !_’
‘_I_’ m very sorry you ’ ve been annoyed ,_’_said_Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning .
‘ And just as I_’ d taken the highest tree in_the wood ,_’ continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek ,_‘ and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky !
Ugh , Serpent !_’
‘ But I_’_m not a serpent ,_I tell you !_’ said_Alice .
‘_I_’ m a—I ’ m a— ’
‘ Well !
What are you ?_’ said_the Pigeon .
‘_I can see you ’_re trying to invent something !_’
‘ I—I ’ m a_little girl ,_’_said_Alice , rather doubtfully ,_as she remembered the number of changes she_had gone through that day .
‘ A likely story indeed !_’_said_the Pigeon in_a tone of_the deepest contempt .
‘_I_’ ve seen a good many little girls in my time ,_but never one with such a neck as that !
No , no !
You ’_re a serpent ;_and there ’_s no use denying it .
I suppose you ’ ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg !_’
‘_I have tasted eggs , certainly ,_’_said_Alice , who was a very truthful child ;_‘ but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do ,_you know ._’
‘_I don_’_t believe it ,_’_said_the Pigeon ;_‘ but if they do , why then they ’_re a kind of serpent ,_that ’_s all I can say ._’
This was such a new idea to Alice ,_that she_was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding ,_‘ You ’_re looking for eggs ,_I know that well enough ;_and what does it matter to me whether you ’_re a_little girl or a serpent ?_’
‘_It matters a good deal to me ,_’_said_Alice hastily ;_‘ but I_’_m not looking for eggs ,_as it happens ;_and if I was ,_I shouldn ’_t want yours : I don_’_t like them raw ._’
‘ Well , be off , then !_’_said_the Pigeon in_a sulky tone ,_as it settled down again into its nest .
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as_she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches ,_and every now and then she_had to stop and untwist it .
After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands ,_and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at_the other ,_and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she_had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .
It was so long since she_had been anything near the right size ,_that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in_a few minutes ,_and began talking to_herself ,_as usual .
‘ Come , there ’_s half my plan done now !
How puzzling all these changes are !
I_’_m never sure what I_’_m going to_be , from one minute to another !
However , I_’ ve got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to_be done ,_I wonder ?_’ As she said this ,_she came suddenly upon an open place ,_with a_little house in it about four feet high .
‘ Whoever lives there ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ it ’ ll never do to come upon them this size : why ,_I should frighten them out of their wits !_’ So she began nibbling at_the righthand bit again ,_and did not venture to go near the house till she_had brought herself down to nine inches high .
CHAPTER VI .
Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two she stood looking at_the house ,_and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of_the wood— ( she considered him to_be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only ,_she would have called him a fish ) —and rapped loudly at_the door with his knuckles .
It was opened by another footman in livery ,_with a round face ,_and large eyes like a frog ;_and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads .
She felt very curious to know what it_was all about ,_and crept a_little way out of_the wood to listen .
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself ,_and this he handed over to_the other , saying , in_a solemn tone ,_‘ For the Duchess .
An invitation from the_Queen to play croquet. ’ The Frog-Footman repeated , in_the same solemn tone , only changing the order of_the words a_little ,_‘ From the_Queen .
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet ._’
Then they both bowed low ,_and their curls got entangled together .
Alice laughed so much at this ,_that she_had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ;_and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone ,_and_the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .
Alice went timidly up to_the door ,_and knocked .
‘ There ’_s no sort of use in knocking ,_’_said_the Footman ,_‘ and that for two reasons .
First , because I_’_m on the same side of_the door as you are ; secondly , because they ’_re making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you. ’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing ,_and every now and then a great crash ,_as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .
‘ Please , then ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ how am I to get in ?_’
‘ There might be some sense in your knocking ,_’_the Footman went_on without attending to her ,_‘ if we had the door between us .
For instance , if you were inside ,_you might knock ,_and I could let you out ,_you know. ’ He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking ,_and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil .
‘ But perhaps he can ’_t help it ,_’ she said to_herself ;_‘ his eyes are so very nearly at_the top of his head .
But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in ?_’ she repeated , aloud .
‘_I shall sit here ,_’_the Footman remarked ,_‘ till tomorrow— ’
At this moment the door of_the house opened ,_and a large plate came skimming out , straight at_the Footman ’_s head : it just grazed his nose ,_and broke to pieces against one of_the trees behind him .
‘ —or next day , maybe ,_’_the Footman continued in_the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .
‘ How am I to get in ?_’ asked Alice again , in_a louder tone .
‘ Are you to get in at all ?_’ said_the Footman .
‘ That ’_s the first question ,_you know ._’
It was , no doubt : only Alice did not like to_be told so .
‘_It ’_s really dreadful ,_’ she muttered to_herself ,_‘ the way all the creatures argue .
It ’_s enough to drive one crazy !_’
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark ,_with variations .
‘_I shall sit here ,_’ he said ,_‘ on and off , for days and days ._’
‘ But what am I to do ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Anything you like ,_’_said_the Footman ,_and began whistling .
‘ Oh , there ’_s no use in talking to him ,_’_said_Alice desperately :_‘ he ’_s perfectly idiotic !_’ And she opened the door and went in .
The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to_the other : the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in_the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to_be full of soup .
‘ There ’_s certainly too much pepper in that soup !_’ Alice said to_herself ,_as well as_she could for sneezing .
There was certainly too much of it in_the air .
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ;_and as for the baby , it_was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment ’_s pause .
The only things in_the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook ,_and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .
‘ Please would you tell me ,_’_said_Alice , a_little timidly , for she_was not quite sure whether it_was good manners for her to speak first ,_‘ why your cat grins like that ?_’
‘_It ’_s a Cheshire cat ,_’_said_the Duchess ,_‘ and that ’_s why .
Pig !_’
She said_the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it_was addressed to_the baby ,_and not to her , so she took courage ,_and went_on again : —
‘_I didn ’_t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact ,_I didn ’_t know that cats could grin ._’
‘ They all can ,_’_said_the Duchess ;_‘ and most of ‘ em do ._’
‘_I don_’_t know of any that do ,_’ Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .
‘_You don_’_t know much ,_’_said_the Duchess ;_‘ and that ’_s a fact ._’
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark ,_and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation .
While she_was trying to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire ,_and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at_the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans , plates ,_and dishes .
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ;_and the baby was howling so much already ,_that it_was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
‘ Oh , please mind what you ’_re doing !_’ cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror .
‘ Oh , there goes his precious nose ’ ; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it ,_and very nearly carried it off .
‘ If everybody minded their own business ,_’_the Duchess said in_a hoarse growl ,_‘ the world would go round a deal faster than it does ._’
‘ Which would not be an advantage ,_’_said_Alice , who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a_little of her knowledge .
‘ Just think of what work it would make with the day and night !
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis— ’
‘ Talking of axes ,_’_said_the Duchess ,_‘ chop off her head !_’
Alice glanced rather anxiously at_the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup ,_and seemed not to_be listening , so she went_on again :_‘ Twenty-four hours ,_I think ; or is it twelve ?
I— ’
‘ Oh , don_’_t bother me ,_’_said_the Duchess ; ‘_I never could abide figures !_’ And with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of lullaby to it as_she did so ,_and giving it a violent shake at_the end of every line :
‘ Speak roughly to your little boy ,
And beat him when he sneezes :
He only does it to annoy ,
Because he knows it teases ._’
CHORUS .
( In which the cook and the baby joined ) : —
‘ Wow !
wow !
wow !_’
While the Duchess sang the second verse of_the song ,_she kept tossing the baby violently up and down ,_and_the poor little thing howled so ,_that Alice could hardly hear the words : —
‘_I speak severely to my boy ,
I beat him when he sneezes ;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases !_’
CHORUS .
‘ Wow !
wow !
wow !_’
‘ Here !
you may nurse it a bit , if you like !_’ the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as_she spoke .
‘_I must go and get ready to play croquet with the_Queen ,_’ and she hurried out of_the room .
The cook threw a frying-pan after her as_she went out ,_but it just missed her .
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty ,_as it_was a queer-shaped little creature ,_and held out its arms and legs in all directions ,_‘ just like a star-fish ,_’ thought Alice .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it ,_and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it_was as much as_she could do to hold it .
As soon as she_had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot ,_and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself , ) she carried it out into the open air .
‘ If I don_’_t take this child away with me ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ they ’_re sure to kill it in_a day or two : wouldn ’_t it be murder to leave it behind ?_’ She said_the last words out loud ,_and_the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) .
‘ Don ’_t grunt ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ that ’_s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself ._’
The baby grunted again ,_and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it .
There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of_the thing at all .
‘ But perhaps it_was only sobbing ,_’ she thought ,_and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears .
No , there were no tears .
‘ If you ’_re going to turn into a pig , my dear ,_’_said_Alice , seriously ,_‘ I_’ ll have nothing more to do with you .
Mind now !_’ The poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it_was impossible to say which ) ,_and they went_on for some while in silence .
Alice was just beginning to think to_herself ,_‘ Now , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ?_’ when it grunted again , so violently ,_that she looked down into its face in some alarm .
This time there could be no mistake about it : it_was neither more nor less than a pig ,_and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further .
So she set the little creature down ,_and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .
‘ If it had grown up ,_’ she said to_herself ,_‘ it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig ,_I think. ’ And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs ,_and was just saying to_herself ,_‘ if one only knew the right way to change them— ’ when she_was a_little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice .
It looked good-natured ,_she thought : still it had very long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to_be treated with respect .
‘ Cheshire Puss ,_’ she began , rather timidly ,_as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however , it only grinned a_little wider .
‘ Come , it ’_s pleased so far ,_’ thought Alice ,_and she went_on .
‘ Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ?_’
‘ That depends a good deal on where you want to get to ,_’_said_the Cat .
‘_I don_’_t much care where— ’ said_Alice .
‘ Then it doesn ’_t matter which way you go ,_’_said_the Cat .
‘ —so long as I get somewhere ,_’ Alice added as an explanation .
‘ Oh ,_you ’_re sure to do that ,_’_said_the Cat ,_‘ if you only walk long enough ._’
Alice felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another question .
‘ What sort of people live about here ?_’
‘ In that direction ,_’_the Cat said , waving its right paw round ,_‘ lives a Hatter : and in that direction ,_’ waving the other paw ,_‘ lives a March Hare .
Visit either you like : they ’_re both mad ._’
‘ But I don_’_t want to go among mad people ,_’ Alice remarked .
‘ Oh ,_you can ’_t help that ,_’_said_the Cat :_‘ we ’_re all mad here .
I_’_m mad .
You ’_re mad ._’
‘ How do you know I_’_m mad ?_’ said_Alice .
‘_You must be ,_’_said_the Cat ,_‘ or you wouldn ’_t have come here ._’
Alice didn ’_t think that proved it at all ; however ,_she went_on ‘ And how do you know that you ’_re mad ?_’
‘ To begin with ,_’_said_the Cat ,_‘ a dog ’_s not mad .
You grant that ?_’
‘_I suppose so ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Well , then ,_’_the Cat went_on ,_‘ you see , a dog growls when it ’_s angry ,_and wags its tail when it ’_s pleased .
Now I growl when I_’_m pleased ,_and wag my tail when I_’_m angry .
Therefore I_’_m mad ._’
‘_I call it purring , not growling ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Call it what you like ,_’_said_the Cat .
‘ Do you play croquet with the_Queen to-day ?_’
‘_I should like it very much ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ but I haven ’_t been invited yet ._’
‘_You ’ ll see me there ,_’_said_the Cat ,_and vanished .
Alice was not much surprised at this ,_she was getting so used to queer things happening .
While she_was looking at_the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .
‘ By-the-bye , what became of_the baby ?_’ said_the Cat .
‘_I_’ d nearly forgotten to ask ._’
‘_It turned into a pig ,_’ Alice quietly said , just as if it had come back in_a natural way .
‘_I thought it would ,_’_said_the Cat ,_and vanished again .
Alice waited a_little , half expecting to see it again ,_but it did not appear ,_and after a minute or two she walked on in_the direction in which the March Hare was said to live .
‘_I_’ ve seen hatters before ,_’ she said to_herself ;_‘ the March Hare will be much the most interesting ,_and perhaps as this is May it won ’_t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it_was in March. ’ As she said this ,_she looked up ,_and there was the Cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree .
‘ Did you say pig , or fig ?_’ said_the Cat .
‘_I said pig ,_’ replied Alice ;_‘ and I wish you wouldn ’_t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy ._’
‘ All right ,_’_said_the Cat ;_and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of_the tail ,_and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .
‘ Well !
I_’ ve often seen a cat without a grin ,_’ thought Alice ;_‘ but a grin without a cat !
It ’_s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life !_’
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of_the house of_the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .
It was so large a house ,_that she did not like to go nearer till she_had nibbled some more of_the lefthand bit of mushroom ,_and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to_herself ‘ Suppose it should be raving mad after all !
I almost wish I_’ d gone to see the Hatter instead !_’
CHAPTER VII .
A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of_the house ,_and_the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep ,_and_the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it ,_and talking over its head .
‘ Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse ,_’ thought Alice ;_‘ only ,_as it ’_s asleep ,_I suppose it doesn ’_t mind ._’
The table was a large one ,_but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it :_‘ No room !
No room !_’ they cried out when they saw Alice coming .
‘ There ’_s plenty of room !_’ said_Alice indignantly ,_and she sat down in_a large arm-chair at one end of_the table .
‘ Have some wine ,_’_the March Hare said in an encouraging tone .
Alice looked all round the table ,_but there was nothing on it but tea .
‘_I don_’_t see any wine ,_’ she remarked .
‘ There isn ’_t any ,_’_said_the March Hare .
‘ Then it wasn ’_t very civil of you to offer it ,_’_said_Alice angrily .
‘_It wasn ’_t very civil of you to sit down without being invited ,_’_said_the March Hare .
‘_I didn ’_t know it_was your table ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ it ’_s laid for a great many more than three ._’
‘ Your hair wants cutting ,_’_said_the Hatter .
He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity ,_and this was his first speech .
‘_You should learn not to make personal remarks ,_’ Alice said with some severity ;_‘ it ’_s very rude ._’
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he said was ,_‘ Why is a raven like a writing-desk ?_’
‘ Come , we shall have some fun now !_’ thought Alice .
‘_I_’ m glad they ’ ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that ,_’ she added aloud .
‘ Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?_’ said_the March Hare .
‘ Exactly so ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Then you should say what you mean ,_’_the March Hare went_on .
‘_I do ,_’ Alice hastily replied ;_‘ at least—at least I mean what I say—that ’_s the same thing ,_you know ._’
‘ Not the same thing a bit !_’_said_the Hatter .
‘_You might just as well say that “ I see what I eat ” is the same thing as “ I eat what I see ” !_’
‘_You might just as well say ,_’ added the March Hare ,_‘ that “ I like what I get ” is the same thing as “ I get what I like ” !_’
‘_You might just as well say ,_’ added the Dormouse , who seemed to_be talking in his sleep ,_‘ that “ I breathe when I sleep ” is the same thing as “ I sleep when I breathe ” !_’
‘_It is the same thing with you ,_’_said_the Hatter ,_and here the conversation dropped ,_and_the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks , which wasn ’_t much .
The Hatter was the first to break the silence .
‘ What day of_the month is it ?_’ he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket ,_and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then ,_and holding it to his ear .
Alice considered a_little ,_and then said ‘ The fourth ._’
‘ Two days wrong !_’ sighed the Hatter .
‘_I told you butter wouldn ’_t suit the works !_’ he added looking angrily at_the March Hare .
‘_It was the best butter ,_’_the March Hare meekly replied .
‘ Yes ,_but some crumbs must have got in as well ,_’_the Hatter grumbled :_‘ you shouldn ’_t have put it in with the bread-knife ._’
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea ,_and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark ,_‘ It was the best butter ,_you know ._’
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .
‘ What a funny watch !_’ she remarked .
‘_It tells the day of_the month ,_and doesn ’_t tell what o ’ clock it is !_’
‘ Why should it ?_’ muttered the Hatter .
‘ Does your watch tell you what year it is ?_’
‘ Of course not ,_’ Alice replied very readily :_‘ but that ’_s because it stays the same year for such a long time together ._’
‘ Which is just the case with mine ,_’_said_the Hatter .
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled .
The Hatter ’_s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it ,_and yet it_was certainly English .
‘_I don_’_t quite understand you ,_’ she said ,_as politely as_she could .
‘ The Dormouse is asleep again ,_’_said_the Hatter ,_and he poured a_little hot tea upon its nose .
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently ,_and said , without opening its eyes ,_‘ Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself ._’
‘ Have you guessed the riddle yet ?_’ the Hatter said , turning to Alice again .
‘ No ,_I give it up ,_’ Alice replied :_‘ what ’_s the answer ?_’
‘_I haven ’_t the slightest idea ,_’_said_the Hatter .
‘ Nor I ,_’_said_the March Hare .
Alice sighed wearily .
‘_I think you might do something better with the time ,_’ she said ,_‘ than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers ._’
‘ If you knew Time as well as I do ,_’_said_the Hatter ,_‘ you wouldn ’_t talk about wasting it .
It ’_s him ._’
‘_I don_’_t know what you mean ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Of course you don_’_t !_’ the Hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously .
‘_I dare say you never even spoke to Time !_’
‘ Perhaps not ,_’ Alice cautiously replied :_‘ but I know I have to beat time when I learn music ._’
‘ Ah !
that accounts for it ,_’_said_the Hatter .
‘ He won ’_t stand beating .
Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he ’ d do almost anything you liked with the clock .
For instance , suppose it were nine o ’ clock in_the morning , just time to begin lessons : you ’ d only have to whisper a hint to Time ,_and round goes the clock in_a twinkling !
Half-past one , time for dinner !_’
( ‘_I only wish it_was ,_’_the March Hare said to itself in_a whisper . )
‘ That would be grand , certainly ,_’_said_Alice thoughtfully :_‘ but then—I shouldn ’_t be hungry for it ,_you know ._’
‘ Not at first , perhaps ,_’_said_the Hatter :_‘ but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked ._’
‘ Is that the way you manage ?_’ Alice asked .
The Hatter shook his head mournfully .
‘ Not I !_’ he replied .
‘ We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad ,_you know— ’ ( pointing with his tea spoon at_the March Hare , ) ‘ —it was at_the great concert given by the_Queen of Hearts ,_and I had to sing
“ Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
How I wonder what you ’_re at ! ”
You know the song , perhaps ?_’
‘_I_’ ve heard something like it ,_’_said_Alice .
‘_It goes on ,_you know ,_’_the Hatter continued ,_‘ in this way : —
“ Up above the world you fly ,
Like a tea-tray in_the sky .
Twinkle , twinkle— “ ’
Here the Dormouse shook itself ,_and began singing in its sleep ‘ Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle— ’ and went_on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .
‘ Well , I_’ d hardly finished the first verse ,_’_said_the Hatter ,_‘ when the_Queen jumped up and bawled out , “ He ’_s murdering the time !
Off with his head ! ” ’
‘ How dreadfully savage !_’ exclaimed Alice .
‘ And ever since that ,_’_the Hatter went_on in_a mournful tone ,_‘ he won ’_t do a thing I ask !
It ’_s always six o ’ clock now ._’
A bright idea came into Alice ’_s head .
‘ Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here ?_’ she asked .
‘ Yes ,_that ’_s it ,_’_said_the Hatter with a sigh :_‘ it ’_s always tea-time ,_and we ’ ve no time to wash the things between whiles ._’
‘ Then you keep moving round ,_I suppose ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Exactly so ,_’_said_the Hatter :_‘ as the things get used up ._’
‘ But what happens when you come to_the beginning again ?_’ Alice ventured to ask .
‘ Suppose we change the subject ,_’_the March Hare interrupted , yawning .
‘_I_’ m getting tired of this .
I vote the young lady tells us a story ._’
‘_I_’ m afraid I don_’_t know one ,_’_said_Alice , rather alarmed at_the proposal .
‘ Then the Dormouse shall !_’ they both cried .
‘ Wake up , Dormouse !_’ And they pinched it on both sides at once .
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes .
‘_I wasn ’_t asleep ,_’ he said in_a hoarse , feeble voice : ‘_I heard every word you fellows were saying ._’
‘ Tell us a story !_’_said_the March Hare .
‘ Yes , please do !_’ pleaded Alice .
‘ And be quick about it ,_’ added the Hatter ,_‘ or you ’ ll be asleep again before it ’_s done ._’
‘ Once upon a time there were three little sisters ,_’_the Dormouse began in_a great hurry ;_‘ and their names were Elsie , Lacie ,_and Tillie ;_and they lived at_the bottom of a well— ’
‘ What did they live on ?_’ said_Alice , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking .
‘ They lived on treacle ,_’_said_the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
‘ They couldn ’_t have done that ,_you know ,_’ Alice gently remarked ;_‘ they ’ d have been ill ._’
‘ So they were ,_’_said_the Dormouse ;_‘ very ill ._’
Alice tried to fancy to_herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like ,_but it puzzled her too much , so she went_on :_‘ But why did they live at_the bottom of a well ?_’
‘ Take some more tea ,_’_the March Hare said to Alice , very earnestly .
‘_I_’ ve had nothing yet ,_’ Alice replied in an offended tone ,_‘ so I can ’_t take more ._’
‘_You mean you can ’_t take less ,_’_said_the Hatter :_‘ it ’_s very easy to take more than nothing ._’
‘ Nobody asked your opinion ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Who ’_s making personal remarks now ?_’ the Hatter asked triumphantly .
Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter ,_and then turned to_the Dormouse ,_and repeated her question .
‘ Why did they live at_the bottom of a well ?_’
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it ,_and then said ,_‘ It was a treacle-well ._’
‘ There ’_s no such thing !_’ Alice was beginning very angrily ,_but the Hatter and the March Hare went ‘ Sh !
sh !_’ and the Dormouse sulkily remarked ,_‘ If you can ’_t be civil ,_you ’ d better finish the story for yourself ._’
‘ No , please go on !_’ Alice said very humbly ; ‘_I won ’_t interrupt again .
I dare say there may be one ._’
‘ One , indeed !_’_said_the Dormouse indignantly .
However , he consented to go on .
‘ And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw ,_you know— ’
‘ What did they draw ?_’ said_Alice , quite forgetting her promise .
‘ Treacle ,_’_said_the Dormouse , without considering at all this time .
‘_I want a clean cup ,_’ interrupted the Hatter :_‘ let ’_s all move one place on ._’
He moved on as he spoke ,_and_the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouse ’_s place ,_and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of_the March Hare .
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than before ,_as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate .
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again , so she began very cautiously :_‘ But I don_’_t understand .
Where did they draw the treacle from ?_’
‘_You can draw water out of a water-well ,_’_said_the Hatter ;_‘ so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh , stupid ?_’
‘ But they were in_the well ,_’ Alice said to_the Dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark .
‘ Of course they were ’ , said_the Dormouse ;_‘ —well in ._’
This answer so confused poor Alice ,_that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it .
‘ They were learning to draw ,_’_the Dormouse went_on , yawning and rubbing its eyes , for it_was getting very sleepy ;_‘ and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M— ’
‘ Why with an M ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Why not ?_’ said_the March Hare .
Alice was silent .
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time ,_and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a_little shriek ,_and went_on :_‘ —that begins with an M , such as mouse-traps ,_and_the moon ,_and memory ,_and muchness—you know you say things are “ much of a muchness ” —did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ?_’
‘ Really , now you ask me ,_’_said_Alice , very much confused ,_‘ I don_’_t think— ’
‘ Then you shouldn ’_t talk ,_’_said_the Hatter .
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust ,_and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly ,_and neither of_the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
‘ At any rate I_’ ll never go there again !_’ said_Alice as_she picked her way through the wood .
‘_It ’_s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life !_’
Just as_she said this ,_she noticed that one of_the trees had a door leading right into it .
‘ That ’_s very curious !_’ she thought .
‘ But everything ’_s curious today .
I think I may as well go in at once. ’ And in she went .
Once more she found herself in_the long hall ,_and close to_the little glass table .
‘ Now , I_’ ll manage better this time ,_’ she said to_herself ,_and began by taking the little golden key ,_and unlocking the door that led into the garden .
Then she went to work nibbling at_the mushroom ( she_had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she_was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then—she found herself at last in_the beautiful garden , among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains .
CHAPTER VIII .
The Queen ’_s Croquet-Ground
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of_the garden : the roses growing on it were white ,_but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
Alice thought this a very curious thing ,_and she went nearer to watch them ,_and just as_she came up to them she heard one of them say ,_‘ Look out now , Five !
Don ’_t go splashing paint over me like that !_’
‘_I couldn ’_t help it ,_’_said Five , in_a sulky tone ;_‘ Seven jogged my elbow ._’
On which Seven looked up and said ,_‘ That ’_s right , Five !
Always lay the blame on others !_’
‘_You ’ d better not talk !_’ said Five .
‘_I heard the_Queen say only yesterday you deserved to_be beheaded !_’
‘ What for ?_’ said_the one who had spoken first .
‘ That ’_s none of your business , Two !_’ said Seven .
‘ Yes , it is his business !_’ said Five ,_‘ and I_’ ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions ._’
Seven flung down his brush ,_and had just begun ‘ Well , of all the unjust things— ’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice ,_as she stood watching them ,_and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also ,_and all of them bowed low .
‘ Would you tell me ,_’_said_Alice , a_little timidly ,_‘ why you are painting those roses ?_’
Five and Seven said nothing ,_but looked at Two .
Two began in_a low voice ,_‘ Why the fact is ,_you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a red rose-tree ,_and we put a white one in by mistake ;_and if the_Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off ,_you know .
So you see , Miss , we ’_re doing our best , afore she comes , to— ’ At this moment Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ‘ The Queen !
The Queen !_’ and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
There was a sound of many footsteps ,_and Alice looked round , eager to see the_Queen .
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat ,_with their hands and feet at_the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds ,_and walked two and two ,_as the soldiers did .
After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them ,_and_the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens ,_and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it_was talking in_a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said ,_and went by without noticing her .
Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King ’_s crown on a crimson velvet cushion ;_and , last of all this grand procession , came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS .
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners ,_but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ;_‘ and besides , what would be the use of a procession ,_’ thought she ,_‘ if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they couldn ’_t see it ?_’ So she stood still where she_was ,_and waited .
When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her ,_and_the Queen said severely ‘ Who is this ?_’ She said it to_the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .
‘ Idiot !_’_said_the Queen , tossing her head impatiently ;_and , turning to Alice ,_she went_on ,_‘ What ’_s your name , child ?_’
‘ My name is Alice , so please your Majesty ,_’_said_Alice very politely ; but she added , to_herself ,_‘ Why , they ’_re only a pack of cards , after all .
I needn ’_t be afraid of them !_’
‘ And who are these ?_’ said_the Queen , pointing to_the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ; for ,_you see ,_as they were lying on their faces ,_and_the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of_the pack ,_she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .
‘ How should I know ?_’ said_Alice , surprised at her own courage .
‘_It ’_s no business of mine ._’
The Queen turned crimson with fury ,_and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed ‘ Off with her head !
Off— ’
‘ Nonsense !_’ said_Alice , very loudly and decidedly ,_and_the Queen was silent .
The King laid his hand upon her arm ,_and timidly said ‘ Consider , my dear : she is only a child !_’
The Queen turned angrily away from him ,_and said to_the Knave ‘ Turn them over !_’
The Knave did so , very carefully ,_with one foot .
‘ Get up !_’_said_the Queen , in_a shrill , loud voice ,_and_the three gardeners instantly jumped up ,_and began bowing to_the King , the_Queen , the royal children ,_and everybody else .
‘ Leave off that !_’ screamed the_Queen .
‘_You make me giddy. ’ And then , turning to_the rose-tree ,_she went_on ,_‘ What have you been doing here ?_’
‘ May it please your Majesty ,_’_said Two , in_a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke ,_‘ we were trying— ’
‘_I see !_’_said_the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
‘ Off with their heads !_’ and the procession moved on , three of_the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners , who ran to Alice for protection .
‘_You shan ’_t be beheaded !_’ said_Alice ,_and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near .
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two , looking for them ,_and then quietly marched off after the others .
‘ Are their heads off ?_’ shouted the_Queen .
‘ Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty !_’ the soldiers shouted in reply .
‘ That ’_s right !_’ shouted the_Queen .
‘ Can you play croquet ?_’
The soldiers were silent ,_and looked at Alice ,_as the question was evidently meant for her .
‘ Yes !_’ shouted Alice .
‘ Come on , then !_’ roared the_Queen ,_and Alice joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next .
‘_It ’ s—it ’_s a very fine day !_’ said a timid voice at her side .
She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .
‘ Very ,_’_said_Alice :_‘ —where ’_s the Duchess ?_’
‘ Hush !
Hush !_’_said_the Rabbit in_a low , hurried tone .
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke ,_and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear ,_and whispered ‘ She ’_s under sentence of execution ._’
‘ What for ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Did you say “ What a pity ! ” ?_’ the Rabbit asked .
‘ No ,_I didn ’_t ,_’_said_Alice : ‘_I don_’_t think it ’_s at all a pity .
I said “ What for ? ” ’
‘ She boxed the_Queen ’_s ears— ’ the Rabbit began .
Alice gave a_little scream of laughter .
‘ Oh , hush !_’ the Rabbit whispered in_a frightened tone .
‘ The Queen will hear you !
You see ,_she came rather late ,_and_the Queen said— ’
‘ Get to your places !_’ shouted the_Queen in_a voice of thunder ,_and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other ; however , they got settled down in_a minute or two ,_and_the game began .
Alice thought she_had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it_was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes ,_and_the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm ,_with its legs hanging down ,_but generally , just as she_had got its neck nicely straightened out ,_and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face ,_with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she_had got its head down ,_and was going to begin again , it_was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself ,_and was in_the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in_the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to ,_and ,_as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of_the ground , Alice soon came to_the conclusion that it_was a very difficult game indeed .
The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while ,_and fighting for the hedgehogs ;_and in_a very short time the_Queen was in_a furious passion ,_and went stamping about ,_and shouting ‘ Off with his head !_’ or ‘ Off with her head !_’ about once in_a minute .
Alice began to feel very uneasy : to_be sure , she_had not as yet had any dispute with the_Queen ,_but she knew that it might happen any minute ,_‘ and then ,_’ thought she ,_‘ what would become of me ?
They ’_re dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is ,_that there ’_s any one left alive !_’
She was looking about for some way of escape ,_and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in_the air : it puzzled her very much at first ,_but , after watching it a minute or two ,_she made it out to_be a grin ,_and she said to_herself ‘_It ’_s the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to ._’
‘ How are you getting on ?_’ said_the Cat ,_as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with .
Alice waited till the eyes appeared ,_and then nodded .
‘_It ’_s no use speaking to it ,_’ she thought ,_‘ till its ears have come , or at least one of them. ’ In another minute the whole head appeared ,_and then Alice put down her flamingo ,_and began an account of_the game , feeling very glad she_had someone to listen to her .
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight ,_and no more of it appeared .
‘_I don_’_t think they play at all fairly ,_’ Alice began , in rather a complaining tone ,_‘ and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can ’_t hear oneself speak—and they don_’_t seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them—and you ’ ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there ’_s the arch I_’ ve got to go through next walking about at_the other end of_the ground—and I should have croqueted the_Queen ’_s hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming !_’
‘ How do you like the_Queen ?_’ said_the Cat in_a low voice .
‘ Not at all ,_’_said_Alice :_‘ she ’_s so extremely— ’ Just then she noticed that the_Queen was close behind her , listening : so she went_on ,_‘ —likely to win ,_that it ’_s hardly worth while finishing the game ._’
The Queen smiled and passed on .
‘ Who are you talking to ?_’ said_the King , going up to Alice ,_and looking at_the Cat ’_s head with great curiosity .
‘_It ’_s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat ,_’_said_Alice :_‘ allow me to introduce it ._’
‘_I don_’_t like the look of it at all ,_’_said_the King :_‘ however , it may kiss my hand if it likes ._’
‘_I_’ d rather not ,_’_the Cat remarked .
‘ Don ’_t be impertinent ,_’_said_the King ,_‘ and don_’_t look at me like that !_’ He got behind Alice as he spoke .
‘ A cat may look at a king ,_’_said_Alice .
‘_I_’ ve read that in some book ,_but I don_’_t remember where ._’
‘ Well , it must be removed ,_’_said_the King very decidedly ,_and he called the_Queen , who was passing at_the moment ,_‘ My dear !
I wish you would have this cat removed !_’
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
‘ Off with his head !_’ she said , without even looking round .
‘_I_’ ll fetch the executioner myself ,_’_said_the King eagerly ,_and he hurried off .
Alice thought she might as well go back ,_and see how the game was going on ,_as she heard the_Queen ’_s voice in_the distance , screaming with passion .
She had already heard her sentence three of_the players to_be executed for having missed their turns ,_and she did not like the look of things at all ,_as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it_was her turn or not .
So she went in search of her hedgehog .
The hedgehog was engaged in_a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was ,_that her flamingo was gone across to_the other side of_the garden , where Alice could see it trying in_a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .
By the time she_had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over ,_and both the hedgehogs were out of sight :_‘ but it doesn ’_t matter much ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ as all the arches are gone from this side of_the ground. ’ So she tucked it away under her arm ,_that it might not escape again ,_and went back for a_little more conversation with her friend .
When she got back to_the Cheshire Cat ,_she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the King ,_and_the Queen , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent ,_and looked very uncomfortable .
The moment Alice appeared ,_she was appealed to by all three to settle the question ,_and they repeated their arguments to her , though ,_as they all spoke at once ,_she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .
The executioner ’_s argument was ,_that you couldn ’_t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before ,_and he wasn ’_t going to begin at his time of life .
The King ’_s argument was ,_that anything that had a head could be beheaded ,_and that you weren ’_t to talk nonsense .
The Queen ’_s argument was ,_that if something wasn ’_t done about it in less than no time she ’ d have everybody executed , all round .
( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious . )
Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘_It belongs to_the Duchess : you ’ d better ask her about it ._’
‘ She ’_s in prison ,_’_the Queen said to_the executioner :_‘ fetch her here. ’ And the executioner went off like an arrow .
The Cat ’_s head began fading away the moment he was gone ,_and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of_the party went back to_the game .
CHAPTER IX .
The Mock_Turtle ’_s Story
‘_You can ’_t think how glad I am to see you again ,_you dear old thing !_’_said_the Duchess ,_as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice ’_s ,_and they walked off together .
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper ,_and thought to_herself that perhaps it_was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in_the kitchen .
‘ When I_’_m a Duchess ,_’ she said to_herself , ( not in_a very hopeful tone though ) ,_‘ I won ’_t have any pepper in my kitchen at all .
Soup does very well without—Maybe it ’_s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered ,_’ she went_on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule ,_‘ and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered .
I only wish people knew that : then they wouldn ’_t be so stingy about it ,_you know— ’
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time ,_and was a_little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .
‘_You ’_re thinking about something , my dear ,_and that makes you forget to talk .
I can ’_t tell you just now what the moral of that is ,_but I shall remember it in_a bit ._’
‘ Perhaps it hasn ’_t one ,_’ Alice ventured to remark .
‘ Tut , tut , child !_’_said_the Duchess .
‘ Everything ’_s got a moral , if only you can find it. ’ And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice ’_s side as_she spoke .
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the Duchess was very ugly ;_and secondly , because she_was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice ’_s shoulder ,_and it_was an uncomfortably sharp chin .
However ,_she did not like to_be rude , so she bore it as well as_she could .
‘ The game ’_s going on rather better now ,_’ she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a_little .
‘ ’ Tis so ,_’_said_the Duchess :_‘ and the moral of that is— “ Oh ,_‘ tis love ,_‘ tis love ,_that makes the world go round ! ” ’
‘ Somebody said ,_’ Alice whispered ,_‘ that it ’_s done by everybody minding their own business !_’
‘ Ah , well !
It means much the same thing ,_’_said_the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice ’_s shoulder as_she added ,_‘ and the moral of that is— “ Take care of_the sense ,_and_the sounds will take care of themselves . ” ’
‘ How fond she is of finding morals in things !_’ Alice thought to_herself .
‘_I dare say you ’_re wondering why I don_’_t put my arm round your waist ,_’_the Duchess said after a pause :_‘ the reason is ,_that I_’_m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo .
Shall I try the experiment ?_’
‘ He might bite ,_’ Alice cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried .
‘ Very true ,_’_said_the Duchess :_‘ flamingoes and mustard both bite .
And the moral of that is— “ Birds of a feather flock together . ” ’
‘ Only mustard isn ’_t a bird ,_’ Alice remarked .
‘ Right ,_as usual ,_’_said_the Duchess :_‘ what a clear way you have of putting things !_’
‘_It ’_s a mineral ,_I think ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Of course it is ,_’_said_the Duchess , who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said ;_‘ there ’_s a large mustard-mine near here .
And the moral of that is— “ The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours . ” ’
‘ Oh ,_I know !_’ exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark ,_‘ it ’_s a vegetable .
It doesn ’_t look like one ,_but it is ._’
‘_I quite agree with you ,_’_said_the Duchess ;_‘ and the moral of that is— “ Be what you would seem to_be ” —or if you ’ d like it put more simply— “ Never imagine yourself not to_be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to_be otherwise . ” ’
‘_I think I should understand that better ,_’ Alice said very politely ,_‘ if I had it written down : but I can ’_t quite follow it as you say it ._’
‘ That ’_s nothing to what I could say if I chose ,_’_the Duchess replied , in_a pleased tone .
‘ Pray don_’_t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Oh , don_’_t talk about trouble !_’_said_the Duchess .
‘_I make you a present of everything I_’ ve said as yet ._’
‘ A cheap sort of present !_’ thought Alice .
‘_I_’ m glad they don_’_t give birthday presents like that !_’ But she did not venture to say it out loud .
‘ Thinking again ?_’ the Duchess asked ,_with another dig of her sharp little chin .
‘_I_’ ve a right to think ,_’_said_Alice sharply , for she_was beginning to feel a_little worried .
‘ Just about as much right ,_’_said_the Duchess ,_‘ as pigs have to fly ;_and the m— ’
But here , to Alice ’_s great surprise , the Duchess ’_s voice died away , even in_the middle of her favourite word ‘ moral ,_’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .
Alice looked up ,_and there stood the_Queen in front of them ,_with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm .
‘ A fine day , your Majesty !_’ the Duchess began in_a low , weak voice .
‘ Now ,_I give you fair warning ,_’ shouted the_Queen , stamping on the ground as_she spoke ;_‘ either you or your head must be off ,_and that in about half no time !
Take your choice !_’
The Duchess took her choice ,_and was gone in_a moment .
‘ Let ’_s go on with the game ,_’_the Queen said to Alice ;_and Alice was too much frightened to say a word ,_but slowly followed her back to_the croquet-ground .
The other guests had taken advantage of_the Queen ’_s absence ,_and were resting in_the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to_the game , the_Queen merely remarking that a moment ’_s delay would cost them their lives .
All the time they were playing the_Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players ,_and shouting ‘ Off with his head !_’ or ‘ Off with her head !_’ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left ,_and all the players , except the King , the_Queen ,_and Alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution .
Then the_Queen left off , quite out of breath ,_and said to Alice ,_‘ Have you seen the Mock_Turtle yet ?_’
‘ No ,_’_said_Alice .
‘_I don_’_t even know what a Mock_Turtle is ._’
‘_It ’_s the thing Mock_Turtle Soup is made from ,_’_said_the Queen .
‘_I never saw one , or heard of one ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Come on , then ,_’_said_the Queen ,_‘ and he shall tell you his history ,_’
As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in_a low voice , to_the company generally ,_‘ You are all pardoned. ’ ‘ Come ,_that ’_s a good thing !_’ she said to_herself , for she_had felt quite unhappy at_the number of executions the_Queen had ordered .
They very soon came upon a Gryphon , lying fast asleep in_the sun .
( If you don_’_t know what a Gryphon is , look at_the picture . )
‘ Up , lazy thing !_’_said_the Queen ,_‘ and take this young lady to see the Mock_Turtle ,_and to hear his history .
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered ’ ;_and she walked off , leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon .
Alice did not quite like the look of_the creature ,_but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen : so she waited .
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the_Queen till she_was out of sight : then it chuckled .
‘ What fun !_’_said_the Gryphon , half to itself , half to Alice .
‘ What is the fun ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Why ,_she ,_’_said_the Gryphon .
‘_It ’_s all her fancy ,_that : they never executes nobody ,_you know .
Come on !_’
‘ Everybody says “ come on ! ” here ,_’ thought Alice ,_as she went slowly after it : ‘_I never was so ordered about in all my life , never !_’
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock_Turtle in_the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a_little ledge of rock ,_and ,_as they came nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break .
She pitied him deeply .
‘ What is his sorrow ?_’ she asked the Gryphon ,_and_the Gryphon answered , very nearly in_the same words as before ,_‘ It ’_s all his fancy ,_that : he hasn ’_t got no sorrow ,_you know .
Come on !_’
So they went up to_the Mock_Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears ,_but said nothing .
‘ This here young lady ,_’_said_the Gryphon ,_‘ she wants for to know your history ,_she do ._’
‘_I_’ ll tell it her ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle in_a deep , hollow tone :_‘ sit down , both of you ,_and don_’_t speak a word till I_’ ve finished ._’
So they sat down ,_and nobody spoke for some minutes .
Alice thought to_herself ,_‘ I don_’_t see how he can ever finish , if he doesn ’_t begin. ’ But she waited patiently .
‘ Once ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle at last ,_with a deep sigh ,_‘ I was a real Turtle ._’
These words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of ‘ Hjckrrh !_’ from the Gryphon ,_and_the constant heavy sobbing of_the Mock_Turtle .
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying ,_‘ Thank you , sir , for your interesting story ,_’ but she could not help thinking there must be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
‘ When we were little ,_’_the Mock_Turtle went_on at last , more calmly , though still sobbing a_little now and then ,_‘ we went to school in_the sea .
The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise— ’
‘ Why did you call him Tortoise , if he wasn ’_t one ?_’ Alice asked .
‘ We called him Tortoise because he taught us ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle angrily :_‘ really you are very dull !_’
‘_You ought to_be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question ,_’ added the Gryphon ;_and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice , who felt ready to sink into the earth .
At last the Gryphon said to_the Mock_Turtle ,_‘ Drive on , old fellow !
Don ’_t be all day about it !_’ and he went_on in these words :
‘ Yes , we went to school in_the sea , though you mayn ’_t believe it— ’
‘_I never said I didn ’_t !_’ interrupted Alice .
‘_You did ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ Hold your tongue !_’ added the Gryphon , before Alice could speak again .
The Mock_Turtle went_on .
‘ We had the best of educations—in fact , we went to school every day— ’
‘_I_’ ve been to a day-school , too ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ you needn ’_t be so proud as all that ._’
‘ With extras ?_’ asked the Mock_Turtle a_little anxiously .
‘ Yes ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ we learned French and music ._’
‘ And washing ?_’ said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ Certainly not !_’ said_Alice indignantly .
‘ Ah !
then yours wasn ’_t a really good school ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle in_a tone of great relief .
‘ Now at ours they had at_the end of_the bill , “ French , music ,_and washing—extra . ” ’
‘_You couldn ’_t have wanted it much ,_’_said_Alice ;_‘ living at_the bottom of_the sea ._’
‘_I couldn ’_t afford to learn it. ’ said_the Mock_Turtle with a sigh .
‘_I only took the regular course ._’
‘ What was that ?_’ inquired Alice .
‘ Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with ,_’_the Mock_Turtle replied ;_‘ and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition , Distraction , Uglification ,_and Derision ._’
‘_I never heard of “ Uglification , ” ’ Alice ventured to say .
‘ What is it ?_’
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise .
‘ What !
Never heard of uglifying !_’ it exclaimed .
‘_You know what to beautify is ,_I suppose ?_’
‘ Yes ,_’_said_Alice doubtfully :_‘ it means—to—make—anything—prettier ._’
‘ Well , then ,_’_the Gryphon went_on ,_‘ if you don_’_t know what to uglify is ,_you are a simpleton ._’
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to_the Mock_Turtle ,_and said ‘ What else had you to learn ?_’
‘ Well , there was Mystery ,_’_the Mock_Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers ,_‘ —Mystery , ancient and modern ,_with Seaography : then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel ,_that used to come once a week : he taught us Drawling , Stretching ,_and Fainting in Coils ._’
‘ What was that like ?_’ said_Alice .
‘ Well ,_I can ’_t show it you myself ,_’_the Mock_Turtle said : ‘_I_’ m too stiff .
And the Gryphon never learnt it ._’
‘ Hadn ’_t time ,_’_said_the Gryphon : ‘_I went to_the Classics master , though .
He was an old crab , he was ._’
‘_I never went to him ,_’_the Mock_Turtle said with a sigh :_‘ he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say ._’
‘ So he did , so he did ,_’_said_the Gryphon , sighing in his turn ;_and both creatures hid their faces in their paws .
‘ And how many hours a day did you do lessons ?_’ said_Alice , in_a hurry to change the subject .
‘ Ten hours the first day ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle :_‘ nine the next ,_and so on ._’
‘ What a curious plan !_’ exclaimed Alice .
‘ That ’_s the reason they ’_re called lessons ,_’_the Gryphon remarked :_‘ because they lessen from day to day ._’
This was quite a new idea to Alice ,_and she thought it over a_little before she made her next remark .
‘ Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ?_’
‘ Of course it_was ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ And how did you manage on the twelfth ?_’ Alice went_on eagerly .
‘ That ’_s enough about lessons ,_’_the Gryphon interrupted in_a very decided tone :_‘ tell her something about the games now ._’
CHAPTER X .
The Lobster Quadrille
The Mock_Turtle sighed deeply ,_and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes .
He looked at Alice ,_and tried to speak ,_but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
‘ Same as if he had a bone in his throat ,_’_said_the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in_the back .
At last the Mock_Turtle recovered his voice ,_and ,_with tears running down his cheeks , he went_on again : —
‘_You may not have lived much under the sea— ’ ( ‘_I haven ’_t ,_’_said_Alice ) — ‘ and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster— ’ ( Alice began to say ‘_I once tasted— ’ but checked herself hastily ,_and said ‘ No , never ’ ) ‘ —so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is !_’
‘ No , indeed ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ What sort of a dance is it ?_’
‘ Why ,_’_said_the Gryphon ,_‘ you first form into a line along the sea-shore— ’
‘ Two lines !_’ cried the Mock_Turtle .
‘ Seals , turtles , salmon ,_and so on ; then , when you ’ ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of_the way— ’
‘ That generally takes some time ,_’ interrupted the Gryphon .
‘ —you advance twice— ’
‘ Each with a lobster as a partner !_’ cried the Gryphon .
‘ Of course ,_’_the Mock_Turtle said :_‘ advance twice , set to partners— ’
‘ —change lobsters ,_and retire in same order ,_’ continued the Gryphon .
‘ Then ,_you know ,_’_the Mock_Turtle went_on ,_‘ you throw the— ’
‘ The lobsters !_’ shouted the Gryphon ,_with a bound into the air .
‘ —as far out to sea as you can— ’
‘ Swim after them !_’ screamed the Gryphon .
‘ Turn a somersault in_the sea !_’ cried the Mock_Turtle , capering wildly about .
‘ Change lobsters again !_’ yelled the Gryphon at_the top of its voice .
‘ Back to land again ,_and that ’_s all the first figure ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ;_and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly ,_and looked at Alice .
‘_It must be a very pretty dance ,_’_said_Alice timidly .
‘ Would you like to see a_little of it ?_’ said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ Very much indeed ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Come , let ’_s try the first figure !_’_said_the Mock_Turtle to_the Gryphon .
‘ We can do without lobsters ,_you know .
Which shall sing ?_’
‘ Oh ,_you sing ,_’_said_the Gryphon .
‘_I_’ ve forgotten the words ._’
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close ,_and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the Mock_Turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly : —
‘ “ Will you walk a_little faster ? ” said a whiting to a snail .
“ There ’_s a porpoise close behind us ,_and he ’_s treading on my tail .
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance ?
Will you , won ’_t you , will you , won ’_t you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , won ’_t you , will you , won ’_t you , won ’_t you join the dance ?
“ You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us ,_with the lobsters , out to sea ! ”
But the snail replied “ Too far , too far ! ” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly ,_but he would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
‘ “ What matters it how far we go ? ” his scaly friend replied .
“ There is another shore ,_you know , upon the other side .
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale , beloved snail ,_but come and join the dance .
Will you , won ’_t you , will you , won ’_t you , will you join the dance ?
Will you , won ’_t you , will you , won ’_t you , won ’_t you join the dance ? ” ’
‘ Thank you , it ’_s a very interesting dance to watch ,_’_said_Alice , feeling very glad that it_was over at last :_‘ and I do so like that curious song about the whiting !_’
‘ Oh ,_as to_the whiting ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle ,_‘ they—you ’ ve seen them , of course ?_’
‘ Yes ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ I_’ ve often seen them at dinn— ’ she checked herself hastily .
‘_I don_’_t know where Dinn may be ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle ,_‘ but if you ’ ve seen them so often , of course you know what they ’_re like ._’
‘_I believe so ,_’ Alice replied thoughtfully .
‘ They have their tails in their mouths—and they ’_re all over crumbs ._’
‘_You ’_re wrong about the crumbs ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle :_‘ crumbs would all wash off in_the sea .
But they have their tails in their mouths ;_and the reason is— ’ here the Mock_Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.— ‘ Tell her about the reason and all that ,_’ he said to_the Gryphon .
‘ The reason is ,_’_said_the Gryphon ,_‘ that they would go with the lobsters to_the dance .
So they got thrown out to sea .
So they had to fall a long way .
So they got their tails fast in their mouths .
So they couldn ’_t get them out again .
That ’_s all ._’
‘ Thank you ,_’_said_Alice ,_‘ it ’_s very interesting .
I never knew so much about a whiting before ._’
‘_I can tell you more than that , if you like ,_’_said_the Gryphon .
‘ Do you know why it ’_s called a whiting ?_’
‘_I never thought about it ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Why ?_’
‘_It does the boots and shoes ,_’_the Gryphon replied very solemnly .
Alice was thoroughly puzzled .
‘ Does the boots and shoes !_’ she repeated in_a wondering tone .
‘ Why , what are your shoes done with ?_’ said_the Gryphon .
‘_I mean , what makes them so shiny ?_’
Alice looked down at them ,_and considered a_little before she gave her answer .
‘ They ’_re done with blacking ,_I believe ._’
‘ Boots and shoes under the sea ,_’_the Gryphon went_on in_a deep voice ,_‘ are done with a whiting .
Now you know ._’
‘ And what are they made of ?_’ Alice asked in_a tone of great curiosity .
‘ Soles and eels , of course ,_’_the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :_‘ any shrimp could have told you that ._’
‘ If I_’ d been the whiting ,_’_said_Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song ,_‘ I_’ d have said to_the porpoise , “ Keep back , please : we don_’_t want you with us ! ” ’
‘ They were obliged to have him with them ,_’_the Mock_Turtle said :_‘ no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise ._’
‘ Wouldn ’_t it really ?_’ said_Alice in_a tone of great surprise .
‘ Of course not ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle :_‘ why , if a fish came to me ,_and told me he was going a journey ,_I should say “ With what porpoise ? ” ’
‘ Don ’_t you mean “ purpose ” ?_’ said_Alice .
‘_I mean what I say ,_’_the Mock_Turtle replied in an offended tone .
And the Gryphon added ‘ Come , let ’_s hear some of your adventures ._’
‘_I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning ,_’_said_Alice a_little timidly :_‘ but it ’_s no use going back to yesterday , because I was a different person then ._’
‘ Explain all that ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ No , no !
The adventures first ,_’_said_the Gryphon in an impatient tone :_‘ explanations take such a dreadful time ._’
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit .
She was a_little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side ,_and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide ,_but she gained courage as_she went_on .
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to_the part about her repeating ‘_You are old , Father William ,_’ to_the Caterpillar ,_and_the words all coming different ,_and then the Mock_Turtle drew a long breath ,_and said ‘ That ’_s very curious ._’
‘_It ’_s all about as curious as it can be ,_’_said_the Gryphon .
‘_It all came different !_’ the Mock_Turtle repeated thoughtfully .
‘_I should like to hear her try and repeat something now .
Tell her to begin. ’ He looked at_the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice .
‘ Stand up and repeat “ ‘ Tis the voice of_the sluggard , ” ’ said_the Gryphon .
‘ How the creatures order one about ,_and make one repeat lessons !_’ thought Alice ; ‘_I might as well be at school at once. ’ However ,_she got up ,_and began to repeat it ,_but her head was so full of_the Lobster Quadrille ,_that she hardly knew what she_was saying ,_and_the words came very queer indeed : —
‘ ’ Tis the voice of_the Lobster ; I heard him declare ,
“ You have baked me too brown ,_I must sugar my hair . ”
As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons ,_and turns out his toes ._’
[ later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry , he is gay as a lark ,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of_the Shark ,
But , when the tide rises and sharks are around ,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound . ]
‘ That ’_s different from what I used to say when I was a child ,_’_said_the Gryphon .
‘ Well ,_I never heard it before ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle ;_‘ but it sounds uncommon nonsense ._’
Alice said nothing ; she_had sat down with her face in her hands , wondering if anything would ever happen in_a natural way again .
‘_I should like to have it explained ,_’_said_the Mock_Turtle .
‘ She can ’_t explain it ,_’_said_the Gryphon hastily .
‘ Go on with the next verse ._’
‘ But about his toes ?_’ the Mock_Turtle persisted .
‘ How could he turn them out with his nose ,_you know ?_’
‘_It ’_s the first position in dancing. ’ Alice said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing ,_and longed to change the subject .
‘ Go on with the next verse ,_’_the Gryphon repeated impatiently :_‘ it begins “ I passed by his garden . ” ’
Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong ,_and she went_on in_a trembling voice : —
‘_I passed by his garden ,_and marked ,_with one eye ,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie— ’
[ later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust ,_and gravy ,_and meat ,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of_the treat .
When the pie was all finished , the Owl ,_as a boon ,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon :
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl ,
And concluded the banquet— ]
‘ What is the use of repeating all that stuff ,_’_the Mock_Turtle interrupted ,_‘ if you don_’_t explain it as you go on ?
It ’_s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard !_’
‘ Yes ,_I think you ’ d better leave off ,_’_said_the Gryphon : and Alice was only too glad to do so .
‘ Shall we try another figure of_the Lobster Quadrille ?_’ the Gryphon went_on .
‘ Or would you like the Mock_Turtle to sing you a song ?_’
‘ Oh , a song , please , if the Mock_Turtle would be so kind ,_’ Alice replied , so eagerly that the Gryphon said , in_a rather offended tone ,_‘ Hm !
No accounting for tastes !
Sing her “ Turtle Soup , ” will you , old fellow ?_’
The Mock_Turtle sighed deeply ,_and began , in_a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this : —
‘ Beautiful Soup , so rich and green ,
Waiting in_a hot tureen !
Who for such dainties would not stoop ?
Soup of_the evening , beautiful Soup !
Soup of_the evening , beautiful Soup !
Beau—ootiful Soo—oop !
Beau—ootiful Soo—oop !
Soo—oop of_the e—e—evening ,
Beautiful , beautiful Soup !
‘ Beautiful Soup !
Who cares for fish ,
Game , or any other dish ?
Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Beau—ootiful Soo—oop !
Beau—ootiful Soo—oop !
Soo—oop of_the e—e—evening ,
Beautiful , beauti—FUL SOUP !_’
‘ Chorus again !_’ cried the Gryphon ,_and_the Mock_Turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of ‘ The trial ’_s beginning !_’ was heard in_the distance .
‘ Come on !_’ cried the Gryphon ,_and , taking Alice by the hand , it hurried off , without waiting for the end of_the song .
‘ What trial is it ?_’ Alice panted as_she ran ; but the Gryphon only answered ‘ Come on !_’ and ran the faster , while more and more faintly came , carried on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words : —
‘ Soo—oop of_the e—e—evening ,
Beautiful , beautiful Soup !_’
CHAPTER XI .
Who Stole the Tarts ?
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived ,_with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts ,_as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them , in chains ,_with a soldier on each side to guard him ;_and near the King was the White Rabbit ,_with a trumpet in one hand ,_and a scroll of parchment in_the other .
In the very middle of_the court was a table ,_with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good ,_that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them— ‘_I wish they ’ d get the trial done ,_’ she thought ,_‘ and hand round the refreshments !_’ But there seemed to_be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time .
Alice had never been in_a court of justice before ,_but she_had read about them in books ,_and she_was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there .
‘ That ’_s the judge ,_’ she said to_herself ,_‘ because of his great wig ._’
The judge , by the way , was the King ;_and as he wore his crown over the wig , ( look at_the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it , ) he did not look at all comfortable ,_and it_was certainly not becoming .
‘ And that ’_s the jury-box ,_’ thought Alice ,_‘ and those twelve creatures ,_’ ( she_was obliged to say ‘ creatures ,_’ you see , because some of them were animals ,_and some were birds , ) ‘_I suppose they are the jurors. ’ She said this last word two or three times over to_herself , being rather proud of it : for she thought ,_and rightly too ,_that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all .
However ,_‘ jury-men ’ would have done just as well .
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates .
‘ What are they doing ?_’ Alice whispered to_the Gryphon .
‘ They can ’_t have anything to put down yet , before the trial ’_s begun ._’
‘ They ’_re putting down their names ,_’_the Gryphon whispered in reply ,_‘ for fear they should forget them before the end of_the trial ._’
‘ Stupid things !_’ Alice began in_a loud , indignant voice ,_but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out ,_‘ Silence in_the court !_’ and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking .
Alice could see ,_as well as if she were looking over their shoulders ,_that all the jurors were writing down ‘ stupid things !_’ on their slates ,_and she could even make out that one of them didn ’_t know how to spell ‘ stupid ,_’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him .
‘ A nice muddle their slates ’ ll be in before the trial ’_s over !_’ thought Alice .
One of_the jurors had a pencil that squeaked .
This of course , Alice could not stand ,_and she went round the court and got behind him ,_and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away .
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it_was Bill , the Lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of_the day ;_and this was of very little use ,_as it left no mark on the slate .
‘ Herald , read the accusation !_’_said_the King .
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet ,_and then unrolled the parchment scroll ,_and read as follows : —
‘ The Queen of Hearts ,_she made some tarts ,
All on a summer day :
The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts ,
And took them quite away !_’
‘ Consider your verdict ,_’_the King said to_the jury .
‘ Not yet , not yet !_’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted .
‘ There ’_s a great deal to come before that !_’
‘ Call the first witness ,_’_said_the King ;_and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet ,_and called out ,_‘ First witness !_’
The first witness was the Hatter .
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in_the other .
‘_I beg pardon , your Majesty ,_’ he began ,_‘ for bringing these in : but I hadn ’_t quite finished my tea when I was sent for ._’
‘_You ought to have finished ,_’_said_the King .
‘ When did you begin ?_’
The Hatter looked at_the March Hare , who had followed him into the court , arm-in-arm with the Dormouse .
‘ Fourteenth of March ,_I think it_was ,_’ he said .
‘ Fifteenth ,_’_said_the March Hare .
‘ Sixteenth ,_’ added the Dormouse .
‘ Write that down ,_’_the King said to_the jury ,_and_the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates ,_and then added them up ,_and reduced the answer to shillings and pence .
‘ Take off your hat ,_’_the King said to_the Hatter .
‘_It isn ’_t mine ,_’_said_the Hatter .
‘ Stolen !_’ the King exclaimed , turning to_the jury , who instantly made a memorandum of_the fact .
‘_I keep them to sell ,_’_the Hatter added as an explanation ; ‘_I_’ ve none of my own .
I_’_m a hatter ._’
Here the_Queen put on her spectacles ,_and began staring at_the Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted .
‘ Give your evidence ,_’_said_the King ;_‘ and don_’_t be nervous , or I_’ ll have you executed on the spot ._’
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all : he kept shifting from one foot to_the other , looking uneasily at_the Queen ,_and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of_the bread-and-butter .
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation , which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it_was : she_was beginning to grow larger again ,_and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she_was as long as there was room for her .
‘_I wish you wouldn ’_t squeeze so. ’ said_the Dormouse , who was sitting next to her .
‘_I can hardly breathe ._’
‘_I can ’_t help it ,_’_said_Alice very meekly : ‘_I_’ m growing ._’
‘_You ’ ve no right to grow here ,_’_said_the Dormouse .
‘ Don ’_t talk nonsense ,_’_said_Alice more boldly :_‘ you know you ’_re growing too ._’
‘ Yes ,_but I grow at a reasonable pace ,_’_said_the Dormouse :_‘ not in that ridiculous fashion. ’ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to_the other side of_the court .
All this time the_Queen had never left off staring at_the Hatter ,_and , just as the Dormouse crossed the court ,_she said to one of_the officers of_the court ,_‘ Bring me the list of_the singers in_the last concert !_’ on which the wretched Hatter trembled so ,_that he shook both his shoes off .
‘ Give your evidence ,_’_the King repeated angrily ,_‘ or I_’ ll have you executed , whether you ’_re nervous or not ._’
‘_I_’ m a poor man , your Majesty ,_’_the Hatter began , in_a trembling voice ,_‘ —and I hadn ’_t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of_the tea— ’
‘ The twinkling of_the what ?_’ said_the King .
‘_It began with the tea ,_’_the Hatter replied .
‘ Of course twinkling begins with a T !_’_said_the King sharply .
‘ Do you take me for a dunce ?
Go on !_’
‘_I_’ m a poor man ,_’_the Hatter went_on ,_‘ and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said— ’
‘_I didn ’_t !_’ the March Hare interrupted in_a great hurry .
‘_You did !_’_said_the Hatter .
‘_I deny it !_’_said_the March Hare .
‘ He denies it ,_’_said_the King :_‘ leave out that part ._’
‘ Well , at any rate , the Dormouse said— ’ the Hatter went_on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the Dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep .
‘ After that ,_’ continued the Hatter ,_‘ I cut some more bread-and-butter— ’
‘ But what did the Dormouse say ?_’ one of_the jury asked .
‘ That I can ’_t remember ,_’_said_the Hatter .
‘_You must remember ,_’ remarked the King ,_‘ or I_’ ll have you executed ._’
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter ,_and went down on one knee .
‘_I_’ m a poor man , your Majesty ,_’ he began .
‘_You ’_re a very poor speaker ,_’_said_the King .
Here one of_the guinea-pigs cheered ,_and was immediately suppressed by the officers of_the court .
( As that is rather a hard word ,_I will just explain to you how it_was done .
They had a large canvas bag , which tied up at_the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea-pig , head first ,_and then sat upon it . )
‘_I_’ m glad I_’ ve seen that done ,_’ thought Alice .
‘_I_’ ve so often read in_the newspapers , at_the end of trials , “ There was some attempts at applause , which was immediately suppressed by the officers of_the court , ” and I never understood what it meant till now ._’
‘ If that ’_s all you know about it ,_you may stand down ,_’ continued the King .
‘_I can ’_t go no lower ,_’_said_the Hatter : ‘_I_’ m on the floor ,_as it is ._’
‘ Then you may sit down ,_’_the King replied .
Here the other guinea-pig cheered ,_and was suppressed .
‘ Come ,_that finished the guinea-pigs !_’ thought Alice .
‘ Now we shall get on better ._’
‘_I_’ d rather finish my tea ,_’_said_the Hatter ,_with an anxious look at_the Queen , who was reading the list of singers .
‘_You may go ,_’_said_the King ,_and_the Hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes on .
‘ —and just take his head off outside ,_’_the Queen added to one of_the officers : but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to_the door .
‘ Call the next witness !_’_said_the King .
The next witness was the Duchess ’_s cook .
She carried the pepper-box in her hand ,_and Alice guessed who it_was , even before she got into the court , by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once .
‘ Give your evidence ,_’_said_the King .
‘ Shan ’_t ,_’_said_the cook .
The King looked anxiously at_the White Rabbit , who said in_a low voice ,_‘ Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness ._’
‘ Well , if I must ,_I must ,_’_the King said ,_with a melancholy air ,_and , after folding his arms and frowning at_the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight , he said in_a deep voice ,_‘ What are tarts made of ?_’
‘ Pepper , mostly ,_’_said_the cook .
‘ Treacle ,_’_said a sleepy voice behind her .
‘ Collar that Dormouse ,_’_the Queen shrieked out .
‘ Behead that Dormouse !
Turn that Dormouse out of court !
Suppress him !
Pinch him !
Off with his whiskers !_’
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion , getting the Dormouse turned out ,_and , by the time they had settled down again , the cook had disappeared .
‘ Never mind !_’_said_the King ,_with an air of great relief .
‘ Call the next witness. ’ And he added in an undertone to_the Queen ,_‘ Really , my dear ,_you must cross-examine the next witness .
It quite makes my forehead ache !_’
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like ,_‘ —for they haven ’_t got much evidence yet ,_’ she said to_herself .
Imagine her surprise , when the White Rabbit read out , at_the top of his shrill little voice , the name ‘ Alice !_’
CHAPTER XII .
Alice ’_s Evidence
‘ Here !_’ cried Alice , quite forgetting in_the flurry of_the moment how large she_had grown in_the last few minutes ,_and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to_the heads of_the crowd below ,_and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she_had accidentally upset the week before .
‘ Oh ,_I beg your pardon !_’ she exclaimed in_a tone of great dismay ,_and began picking them up again as quickly as_she could , for the accident of_the goldfish kept running in her head ,_and she_had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box , or they would die .
‘ The trial can not proceed ,_’_said_the King in_a very grave voice ,_‘ until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all ,_’ he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do .
Alice looked at_the jury-box ,_and saw that , in her haste , she_had put the Lizard in head downwards ,_and_the poor little thing was waving its tail about in_a melancholy way , being quite unable to move .
She soon got it out again ,_and put it right ;_‘ not that it signifies much ,_’ she said to_herself ; ‘_I should think it would be quite as much use in_the trial one way up as the other ._’
As soon as the jury had a_little recovered from the shock of being upset ,_and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of_the accident , all except the Lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of_the court .
‘ What do you know about this business ?_’ the King said to Alice .
‘ Nothing ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ Nothing whatever ?_’ persisted the King .
‘ Nothing whatever ,_’_said_Alice .
‘ That ’_s very important ,_’_the King said , turning to_the jury .
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted :_‘ Unimportant , your Majesty means , of course ,_’ he said in_a very respectful tone ,_but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
‘ Unimportant , of course ,_I meant ,_’_the King hastily said ,_and went_on to himself in an undertone ,
‘ important—unimportant—unimportant—important— ’ as if he were trying which word sounded best .
Some of_the jury wrote it down ‘ important ,_’ and some ‘ unimportant. ’ Alice could see this ,_as she_was near enough to look over their slates ;_‘ but it doesn ’_t matter a bit ,_’ she thought to_herself .
At this moment the King , who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book , cackled out ‘ Silence !_’ and read out from his book ,_‘ Rule Forty-two .
All persons more than a mile high to leave the court ._’
Everybody looked at Alice .
‘_I_’ m not a mile high ,_’_said_Alice .
‘_You are ,_’_said_the King .
‘ Nearly two miles high ,_’ added the_Queen .
‘ Well ,_I shan ’_t go , at any rate ,_’_said_Alice :_‘ besides ,_that ’_s not a regular rule : you invented it just now ._’
‘_It ’_s the oldest rule in_the book ,_’_said_the King .
‘ Then it ought to_be Number One ,_’_said_Alice .
The King turned pale ,_and shut his note-book hastily .
‘ Consider your verdict ,_’ he said to_the jury , in_a low , trembling voice .
‘ There ’_s more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty ,_’_said_the White Rabbit , jumping up in_a great hurry ;_‘ this paper has just been picked up ._’
‘ What ’_s in it ?_’ said_the Queen .
‘_I haven ’_t opened it yet ,_’_said_the White Rabbit ,_‘ but it seems to_be a letter , written by the prisoner to—to somebody ._’
‘_It must have been that ,_’_said_the King ,_‘ unless it_was written to nobody , which isn ’_t usual ,_you know ._’
‘ Who is it directed to ?_’ said one of_the jurymen .
‘_It isn ’_t directed at all ,_’_said_the White Rabbit ;_‘ in fact , there ’_s nothing written on the outside. ’ He unfolded the paper as he spoke ,_and added ‘_It isn ’_t a letter , after all : it ’_s a set of verses ._’
‘ Are they in_the prisoner ’_s handwriting ?_’ asked another of_the jurymen .
‘ No , they ’_re not ,_’_said_the White Rabbit ,_‘ and that ’_s the queerest thing about it. ’ ( The jury all looked puzzled . )
‘ He must have imitated somebody else ’_s hand ,_’_said_the King .
( The jury all brightened up again . )
‘ Please your Majesty ,_’_said_the Knave ,_‘ I didn ’_t write it ,_and they can ’_t prove I did : there ’_s no name signed at_the end ._’
‘ If you didn ’_t sign it ,_’_said_the King ,_‘ that only makes the matter worse .
You must have meant some mischief , or else you ’ d have signed your name like an honest man ._’
There was a general clapping of hands at this : it_was the first really clever thing the King had said that day .
‘ That proves his guilt ,_’_said_the Queen .
‘_It proves nothing of_the sort !_’ said_Alice .
‘ Why ,_you don_’_t even know what they ’_re about !_’
‘ Read them ,_’_said_the King .
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles .
‘ Where shall I begin , please your Majesty ?_’ he asked .
‘ Begin at_the beginning ,_’_the King said gravely ,_‘ and go on till you come to_the end : then stop ._’
These were the verses the White Rabbit read : —
‘ They told me you had been to her ,
And mentioned me to him :
She gave me a good character ,
But said I could not swim .
He sent them word I had not gone
( We know it to_be true ) :
If she should push the matter on ,
What would become of you ?
I gave her one , they gave him two ,
You gave us three or more ;
They all returned from him to you ,
Though they were mine before .
If I or she should chance to_be
Involved in this affair ,
He trusts to you to set them free ,
Exactly as we were .
My notion was that you had been
( Before she_had this fit )
An obstacle that came between
Him ,_and ourselves ,_and it .
Don ’_t let him know she liked them best ,
For this must ever be
A secret , kept from all the rest ,
Between yourself and me ._’
‘ That ’_s the most important piece of evidence we ’ ve heard yet ,_’_said_the King , rubbing his hands ;_‘ so now let the jury— ’
‘ If any one of them can explain it ,_’_said_Alice , ( she_had grown so large in_the last few minutes that she wasn ’_t a bit afraid of interrupting him , ) ‘_I_’ ll give him sixpence .
I don_’_t believe there ’_s an atom of meaning in it ._’
The jury all wrote down on their slates ,_‘ She doesn ’_t believe there ’_s an atom of meaning in it ,_’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper .
‘ If there ’_s no meaning in it ,_’_said_the King ,_‘ that saves a world of trouble ,_you know ,_as we needn ’_t try to find any .
And yet I don_’_t know ,_’ he went_on , spreading out the verses on his knee ,_and looking at them with one eye ; ‘_I seem to see some meaning in them , after all .
“ —said I could not swim— ” you can ’_t swim , can you ?_’ he added , turning to_the Knave .
The Knave shook his head sadly .
‘ Do I look like it ?_’ he said .
( Which he certainly did not , being made entirely of cardboard . )
‘ All right , so far ,_’_said_the King ,_and he went_on muttering over the verses to himself :_‘ “ We know it to_be true— ” that ’_s the jury , of course— “ I gave her one , they gave him two— ” why ,_that must be what he did with the tarts ,_you know— ’
‘ But , it goes on “ they all returned from him to you , ” ’ said_Alice .
‘ Why , there they are !_’_said_the King triumphantly , pointing to_the tarts on the table .
‘ Nothing can be clearer than that .
Then again— “ before she_had this fit— ” you never had fits , my dear ,_I think ?_’ he said to_the Queen .
‘ Never !_’_said_the Queen furiously , throwing an inkstand at_the Lizard as_she spoke .
( The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger ,_as he found it made no mark ; but he now hastily began again , using the ink ,_that was trickling down his face ,_as long as it lasted . )
‘ Then the words don_’_t fit you ,_’_said_the King , looking round the court with a smile .
There was a dead silence .
‘_It ’_s a pun !_’ the King added in an offended tone ,_and everybody laughed ,_‘ Let the jury consider their verdict ,_’_the King said , for about the twentieth time that day .
‘ No , no !_’_said_the Queen .
‘ Sentence first—verdict afterwards ._’
‘ Stuff and nonsense !_’ said_Alice loudly .
‘ The idea of having the sentence first !_’
‘ Hold your tongue !_’_said_the Queen , turning purple .
‘_I won ’_t !_’ said_Alice .
‘ Off with her head !_’ the_Queen shouted at_the top of her voice .
Nobody moved .
‘ Who cares for you ?_’ said_Alice , ( she_had grown to her full size by this time . )
‘_You ’_re nothing but a pack of cards !_’
At this the whole pack rose up into the air ,_and came flying down upon her : she gave a_little scream , half of fright and half of anger ,_and tried to beat them off ,_and found herself lying on the bank ,_with her head in_the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .
‘ Wake up , Alice dear !_’ said her sister ;_‘ Why , what a long sleep you ’ ve had !_’
‘ Oh , I_’ ve had such a curious dream !_’ said_Alice ,_and she told her sister ,_as well as_she could remember them , all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about ;_and when she_had finished , her sister kissed her ,_and said ,_‘ It was a curious dream , dear , certainly : but now run in to your tea ; it ’_s getting late. ’ So Alice got up and ran off , thinking while she ran ,_as well she might , what a wonderful dream it had been .
But her sister sat still just as_she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun ,_and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion ,_and this was her dream : —
First ,_she dreamed of little Alice herself ,_and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee ,_and_the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice ,_and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as_she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister ’_s dream .
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of_the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal ,_and_the shrill voice of_the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess ’_s knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of_the Gryphon , the squeaking of_the Lizard ’_s slate-pencil ,_and_the choking of_the suppressed guinea-pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of_the miserable Mock_Turtle .
So she sat on ,_with closed eyes ,_and half believed herself in Wonderland , though she knew she_had but to open them again ,_and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in_the wind ,_and_the pool rippling to_the waving of_the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells ,_and_the Queen ’_s shrill cries to_the voice of_the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of_the baby , the shriek of_the Gryphon ,_and all the other queer noises , would change ( she knew ) to_the confused clamour of_the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of_the cattle in_the distance would take the place of_the Mock_Turtle ’_s heavy sobs .
Lastly ,_she pictured to_herself how this same little sister of hers would , in_the after-time , be herself a grown woman ;_and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children ,_and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows ,_and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child-life ,_and_the happy summer days .
